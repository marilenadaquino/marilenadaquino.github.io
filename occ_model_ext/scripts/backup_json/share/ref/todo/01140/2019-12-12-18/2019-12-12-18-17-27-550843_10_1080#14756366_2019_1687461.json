The activity of statins was investigated previously in the yeast Candida glabrata13 and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae14; the yeast S. cerevisiae is an excellent unicellular model to gain insights into human diseases1315 in particular, those resulting from impaired mitochondrial function16–18, because S. cerevisiae is able, utilising fermentable carbon sources to survive without mitochondrial respiration.

Here, we expand the analysis of mitochondrial function and the stability of mitochondrial DNA using statins in S. cerevisiae: we showed that these molecules cause a reduction of ergosterol, inducing loss of mitochondrial DNA and resulting in a reduction of mitochondrial respiration/function coupled with the Erg27 re-localisation in ER.

The activity of statins was investigated previously in the yeast Candida glabrata13 and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae14; the yeast S. cerevisiae is an excellent unicellular model to gain insights into human diseases1315 in particular, those resulting from impaired mitochondrial function16–18, because S. cerevisiae is able, utilising fermentable carbon sources to survive without mitochondrial respiration. We previously demonstrated that ketoconazole, which blocks the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway downstream the HMG-CoA reductase, reduced the ergosterol content in yeast cells and induced the loss of mitochondrial DNA; this phenomenon is coupled with a re-localisation of Erg27 enzyme from Lipid Droplets (LDs) to Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)19. Here, we expand the analysis of mitochondrial function and the stability of mitochondrial DNA using statins in S. cerevisiae: we showed that these molecules cause a reduction of ergosterol, inducing loss of mitochondrial DNA and resulting in a reduction of mitochondrial respiration/function coupled with the Erg27 re-localisation in ER. In murine myoblasts, upon statins treatment, we also observed a reduction of mitochondrial DNA copy number associated with an impaired differentiation capacity.",

We confirmed here that statins act as cholesterol lowering drugs in S. cerevisiae as was previously published14; mass spectrometry analysis revealed a lower ergosterol content in statins treated cells than the wild type strain (Supplementary Figure 1); in yeast cells treated with statins, the Erg27 enzyme localised in the endoplasmic reticulum indicating low level of ergosterol, because in cells with normal ergosterol content, the enzyme is localised in lipid droplets19 (Figure 5). Of note, statin treatments resulted in W303 growth curves rates intermediate between the non-treated strain (W303) and the strain devoid of mitochondrial DNA (W303 rho°), while the supply of ergosterol in the medium restores a wild type growth in statin treated cells and in W303 rho° (Supplementary Figure 3(B)). Also, the growth curves of the yeast K. lactis, which has a metabolism more similar to human cells, revealed that statins slightly impair the growth, as in S. cerevisiae (Supplementary Figure 6). Finally, we treated with statins a yeast model of human MELAS disease18.
