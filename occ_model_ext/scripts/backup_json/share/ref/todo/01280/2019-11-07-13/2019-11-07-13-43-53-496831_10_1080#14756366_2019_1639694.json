ALK gene rearrangements result in various ALK fusion oncogenes including EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4)–ALK3 in lung cancers, TPM3 (tropomyosin 3)-ALK in ALCL4 and TPM3/4–ALK5 in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours (IMT)6. ALK gene aberrations found in several human cancers include rearrangement, activating point mutations7 such as F1174L/R1275Q, and gene amplification. ALK has received a great deal of attention as a promising therapeutic target for targeted cancer therapy and, as a result, enormous efforts have been devoted to developing ALK inhibitors. While various scaffolds such as pyrimidine, aminopyridine8,9, benzo[b]carbazolone10, indazole11 have been exploited to identify new ALK inhibitors, 2,4-diarylamino pyrimidines2,12–21 have been the most common molecular platform for discovering ALK inhibitors including ceritinib and brigatinib. Crizotinib22,23 was approved in 2011 as an ALK inhibitor for treatment of NSCLC patients harbouring EML4-ALK fusion oncogene. This substance was also approved in 2016 for treatment of ROS1-positive NSCLC. In 2018, crizotinib was given a breakthrough therapy designation to treat ALK-positive relapsed/refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)24–27 patients. However, acquired secondary mutations (L1196M, G1269A, F1174L, S1206Y, 1151 T-ins, L1152R, C1156Y and G1202R) occurring in the ALK kinase domain resulted in resistance to crizotinib18,20,28–30. The ALK gatekeeper mutation L1196M is the most frequent secondary mutation taking place in NSCLC patients and, consequently, a significant effort has been made to identify novel and potent L1196M inhibitors31. These efforts have led to the development of second-generation ALK inhibitors including ceritinib32,33, alectinib10, lorlatinib8–9, brigatinib34,35, ensartinib36 and entrectinib11 that circumvent the acquired secondary mutations21,37 (Figure 1).",

ALK gene aberrations found in several human cancers include rearrangement, activating point mutations7 such as F1174L/R1275Q, and gene amplification. ALK has received a great deal of attention as a promising therapeutic target for targeted cancer therapy and, as a result, enormous efforts have been devoted to developing ALK inhibitors. While various scaffolds such as pyrimidine, aminopyridine8,9, benzo[b]carbazolone10, indazole11 have been exploited to identify new ALK inhibitors, 2,4-diarylamino pyrimidines2,12–21 have been the most common molecular platform for discovering ALK inhibitors including ceritinib and brigatinib. Crizotinib22,23 was approved in 2011 as an ALK inhibitor for treatment of NSCLC patients harbouring EML4-ALK fusion oncogene. This substance was also approved in 2016 for treatment of ROS1-positive NSCLC. In 2018, crizotinib was given a breakthrough therapy designation to treat ALK-positive relapsed/refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)24–27 patients. However, acquired secondary mutations (L1196M, G1269A, F1174L, S1206Y, 1151 T-ins, L1152R, C1156Y and G1202R) occurring in the ALK kinase domain resulted in resistance to crizotinib18,20,28–30. The ALK gatekeeper mutation L1196M is the most frequent secondary mutation taking place in NSCLC patients and, consequently, a significant effort has been made to identify novel and potent L1196M inhibitors31. These efforts have led to the development of second-generation ALK inhibitors including ceritinib32,33, alectinib10, lorlatinib8–9, brigatinib34,35, ensartinib36 and entrectinib11 that circumvent the acquired secondary mutations21,37 (Figure 1).",

ALK gene rearrangements result in various ALK fusion oncogenes including EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4)–ALK3 in lung cancers, TPM3 (tropomyosin 3)-ALK in ALCL4 and TPM3/4–ALK5 in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours (IMT)6. ALK gene aberrations found in several human cancers include rearrangement, activating point mutations7 such as F1174L/R1275Q, and gene amplification. ALK has received a great deal of attention as a promising therapeutic target for targeted cancer therapy and, as a result, enormous efforts have been devoted to developing ALK inhibitors. While various scaffolds such as pyrimidine, aminopyridine8,9, benzo[b]carbazolone10, indazole11 have been exploited to identify new ALK inhibitors, 2,4-diarylamino pyrimidines2,12–21 have been the most common molecular platform for discovering ALK inhibitors including ceritinib and brigatinib. Crizotinib22,23 was approved in 2011 as an ALK inhibitor for treatment of NSCLC patients harbouring EML4-ALK fusion oncogene. This substance was also approved in 2016 for treatment of ROS1-positive NSCLC. In 2018, crizotinib was given a breakthrough therapy designation to treat ALK-positive relapsed/refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)24–27 patients.

The ALK gatekeeper mutation L1196M is the most frequent secondary mutation taking place in NSCLC patients and, consequently, a significant effort has been made to identify novel and potent L1196M inhibitors31. These efforts have led to the development of second-generation ALK inhibitors including ceritinib32,33, alectinib10, lorlatinib8–9, brigatinib34,35, ensartinib36 and entrectinib11 that circumvent the acquired secondary mutations21,37 (Figure 1).",

ALK gene rearrangements result in various ALK fusion oncogenes including EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4)–ALK3 in lung cancers, TPM3 (tropomyosin 3)-ALK in ALCL4 and TPM3/4–ALK5 in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours (IMT)6. ALK gene aberrations found in several human cancers include rearrangement, activating point mutations7 such as F1174L/R1275Q, and gene amplification. ALK has received a great deal of attention as a promising therapeutic target for targeted cancer therapy and, as a result, enormous efforts have been devoted to developing ALK inhibitors. While various scaffolds such as pyrimidine, aminopyridine8,9, benzo[b]carbazolone10, indazole11 have been exploited to identify new ALK inhibitors, 2,4-diarylamino pyrimidines2,12–21 have been the most common molecular platform for discovering ALK inhibitors including ceritinib and brigatinib. Crizotinib22,23 was approved in 2011 as an ALK inhibitor for treatment of NSCLC patients harbouring EML4-ALK fusion oncogene. This substance was also approved in 2016 for treatment of ROS1-positive NSCLC.

The ALK gatekeeper mutation L1196M is the most frequent secondary mutation taking place in NSCLC patients and, consequently, a significant effort has been made to identify novel and potent L1196M inhibitors31.
