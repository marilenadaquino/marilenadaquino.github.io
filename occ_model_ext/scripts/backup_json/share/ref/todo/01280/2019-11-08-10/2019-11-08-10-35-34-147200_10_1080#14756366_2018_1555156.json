Ferrocenecarboxaldehyde (98%), sulfanilamide (99%), 4-sulfamoylbenzoic acid (97%), methyl-2-(aminosulfonyl)benzoate (98%) and CF3COOH (99%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without additional purification. Solvents such as CH2Cl2, hexane, acetone, EtOH, DMSO, and THF were obtained commercially and purified using standard methods. Infrared spectra were recorded in solid state (KBr pellet) on a Jasco FT-IR 4600 spectrophotometer. 1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker spectrometer model ASCEND TM 400 MHz. All NMR spectra are reported in parts per million (ppm, δ) relative to tetramethylsilane (Me4Si), with the residual solvent proton resonances used as internal standards. Coupling constants (J) are reported in Hertz (Hz), and integrations are reported as number of protons. The following abbreviations were used to describe the peak patterns: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, and m = multiplet.
