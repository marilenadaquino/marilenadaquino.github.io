Recently, we reported on benzenesulphonamide dihydrothiazole derivatives as inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) isozymes I, II, IX, and XII19. This enzyme family catalyses the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons19 and, therefore, plays an essential role in CO2-related metabolism and in its transportation across biological membranes20,21. Due to their simple but essential role, hCAs have been recognised as main actors in a number of physiological processes and pathologies22–30. Not surprisingly, hCA inhibitors have been intensively studied and several are in clinical use for diverse pathologies31–37. Although different mechanisms of inhibition of hCA have been reported (e.g. coumarins, phenols, primary amines, COOMe derivatives)38–42, benzenesulphonamides and their isosters are the most represented molecular class of inhibitors32,43–48. These inhibitors belong to the so called zinc binders. They bind the zinc cofactor as conjugated bases and therefore, the acidity of the sulphonamide group influences their potency. Thus, by conjugating the benzenesulphonamide group to an electron withdrawing heterocyclic ring, the activity could be favourably influenced. Moreover, the introduction of further substituents in the heterocyclic core may influence the isozyme selectivity. On these bases, and according to our previous observation31,47–50, we have synthesised and evaluated for the inhibition activity toward hCA I, II, IX, and XII isoforms a series of the 4-[(3-methyl-4-aryl-2,3-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-ylidene)amino]benzenesulphonamides (Figure 1).",

Recently, we reported on benzenesulphonamide dihydrothiazole derivatives as inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) isozymes I, II, IX, and XII19. This enzyme family catalyses the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons19 and, therefore, plays an essential role in CO2-related metabolism and in its transportation across biological membranes20,21. Due to their simple but essential role, hCAs have been recognised as main actors in a number of physiological processes and pathologies22–30. Not surprisingly, hCA inhibitors have been intensively studied and several are in clinical use for diverse pathologies31–37. Although different mechanisms of inhibition of hCA have been reported (e.g. coumarins, phenols, primary amines, COOMe derivatives)38–42, benzenesulphonamides and their isosters are the most represented molecular class of inhibitors32,43–48. These inhibitors belong to the so called zinc binders. They bind the zinc cofactor as conjugated bases and therefore, the acidity of the sulphonamide group influences their potency. Thus, by conjugating the benzenesulphonamide group to an electron withdrawing heterocyclic ring, the activity could be favourably influenced. Moreover, the introduction of further substituents in the heterocyclic core may influence the isozyme selectivity. On these bases, and according to our previous observation31,47–50, we have synthesised and evaluated for the inhibition activity toward hCA I, II, IX, and XII isoforms a series of the 4-[(3-methyl-4-aryl-2,3-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-ylidene)amino]benzenesulphonamides (Figure 1).",

Not surprisingly, this moiety has been extensively studied and both natural and synthetic thiazole derivatives are in therapeutic use or have shown potential therapeutic application toward several pathologies and targets such as bacteria1,2, tumours3–6, HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase7–12, fungi13–15, neurodegeneration and related pathologies12,16,17, and protozoal infections18. Recently, we reported on benzenesulphonamide dihydrothiazole derivatives as inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) isozymes I, II, IX, and XII19. This enzyme family catalyses the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons19 and, therefore, plays an essential role in CO2-related metabolism and in its transportation across biological membranes20,21. Due to their simple but essential role, hCAs have been recognised as main actors in a number of physiological processes and pathologies22–30. Not surprisingly, hCA inhibitors have been intensively studied and several are in clinical use for diverse pathologies31–37. Although different mechanisms of inhibition of hCA have been reported (e.g. coumarins, phenols, primary amines, COOMe derivatives)38–42, benzenesulphonamides and their isosters are the most represented molecular class of inhibitors32,43–48. These inhibitors belong to the so called zinc binders. They bind the zinc cofactor as conjugated bases and therefore, the acidity of the sulphonamide group influences their potency. Thus, by conjugating the benzenesulphonamide group to an electron withdrawing heterocyclic ring, the activity could be favourably influenced. Moreover, the introduction of further substituents in the heterocyclic core may influence the isozyme selectivity. On these bases, and according to our previous observation31,47–50, we have synthesised and evaluated for the inhibition activity toward hCA I, II, IX, and XII isoforms a series of the 4-[(3-methyl-4-aryl-2,3-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-ylidene)amino]benzenesulphonamides (Figure 1).",

Not surprisingly, this moiety has been extensively studied and both natural and synthetic thiazole derivatives are in therapeutic use or have shown potential therapeutic application toward several pathologies and targets such as bacteria1,2, tumours3–6, HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase7–12, fungi13–15, neurodegeneration and related pathologies12,16,17, and protozoal infections18. Recently, we reported on benzenesulphonamide dihydrothiazole derivatives as inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) isozymes I, II, IX, and XII19. This enzyme family catalyses the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons19 and, therefore, plays an essential role in CO2-related metabolism and in its transportation across biological membranes20,21. Due to their simple but essential role, hCAs have been recognised as main actors in a number of physiological processes and pathologies22–30. Not surprisingly, hCA inhibitors have been intensively studied and several are in clinical use for diverse pathologies31–37. Although different mechanisms of inhibition of hCA have been reported (e.g. coumarins, phenols, primary amines, COOMe derivatives)38–42, benzenesulphonamides and their isosters are the most represented molecular class of inhibitors32,43–48. These inhibitors belong to the so called zinc binders. They bind the zinc cofactor as conjugated bases and therefore, the acidity of the sulphonamide group influences their potency. Thus, by conjugating the benzenesulphonamide group to an electron withdrawing heterocyclic ring, the activity could be favourably influenced. Moreover, the introduction of further substituents in the heterocyclic core may influence the isozyme selectivity. On these bases, and according to our previous observation31,47–50, we have synthesised and evaluated for the inhibition activity toward hCA I, II, IX, and XII isoforms a series of the 4-[(3-methyl-4-aryl-2,3-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-ylidene)amino]benzenesulphonamides (Figure 1).",
