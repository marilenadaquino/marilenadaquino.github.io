It is also popular as an incense for cultural and religious ceremonies and its essential oil is further processed into perfume in cosmetics. Previous chemical studies revealed that sesquiterpenoids and 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone derivatives are the two principal and aroma components in agarwood. To date, over 130 sesquiterpenoids and 120 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone derivatives have been isolated from agarwood9 and many of them exhibited various pharmacological properties including antibacterial10, anti-inflammatory11, α-glucosidase inhibitory12, acetylcholinesterase inhibitory13, cytotoxic12, neuroprotective14, and antidepressant activities15. As part of our long-term project to chemically and biologically characterize chemical constituents from agarwood, the ethyl ether extract of agarwood from an Aquilaria plant was found to potently inhibit α-glucosidase. Then, a phytochemical investigation on the agarwood of an Aquilaria plant was performed and 10 α-glucosidase inhibitory sesquiterpenoids including 6 new sesquiterpenoids, Agarozizanol A − F (1−6), together with 4 known sesquiterpenoids (Figure 1) were isolated and identified. Additionally, 6 known 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromones were also obtained. 2-(2-Phenylethyl)chromones are structurally similar to the flavones except for presence of additional ethyl group and many flavones show intriguing tyrosinase inhibitory activity16–18. Tyrosinase, a rate-limiting enzyme for the melanin biosynthesis, involves in pigmentation of skin19, browning in fresh vegetables and fruits20, cuticle formation in insects21,22, and neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson’s disease23. Hence, tyrosinase inhibitors have broad application in medicines, food preservatives, bio-insecticides, and cosmetic products. Inspired by this, All the 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromones were assayed for their tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Moreover, the inhibition mechanism were investigated. Herein, we report the isolation, structure elucidation, α-glucosidase and tyrosinase inhibitory activities, as well as kinetic and molecular docking studies of these compounds.",

Previous chemical studies revealed that sesquiterpenoids and 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone derivatives are the two principal and aroma components in agarwood. To date, over 130 sesquiterpenoids and 120 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone derivatives have been isolated from agarwood9 and many of them exhibited various pharmacological properties including antibacterial10, anti-inflammatory11, α-glucosidase inhibitory12, acetylcholinesterase inhibitory13, cytotoxic12, neuroprotective14, and antidepressant activities15. As part of our long-term project to chemically and biologically characterize chemical constituents from agarwood, the ethyl ether extract of agarwood from an Aquilaria plant was found to potently inhibit α-glucosidase. Then, a phytochemical investigation on the agarwood of an Aquilaria plant was performed and 10 α-glucosidase inhibitory sesquiterpenoids including 6 new sesquiterpenoids, Agarozizanol A − F (1−6), together with 4 known sesquiterpenoids (Figure 1) were isolated and identified. Additionally, 6 known 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromones were also obtained. 2-(2-Phenylethyl)chromones are structurally similar to the flavones except for presence of additional ethyl group and many flavones show intriguing tyrosinase inhibitory activity16–18. Tyrosinase, a rate-limiting enzyme for the melanin biosynthesis, involves in pigmentation of skin19, browning in fresh vegetables and fruits20, cuticle formation in insects21,22, and neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson’s disease23. Hence, tyrosinase inhibitors have broad application in medicines, food preservatives, bio-insecticides, and cosmetic products. Inspired by this, All the 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromones were assayed for their tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Moreover, the inhibition mechanism were investigated. Herein, we report the isolation, structure elucidation, α-glucosidase and tyrosinase inhibitory activities, as well as kinetic and molecular docking studies of these compounds.",
