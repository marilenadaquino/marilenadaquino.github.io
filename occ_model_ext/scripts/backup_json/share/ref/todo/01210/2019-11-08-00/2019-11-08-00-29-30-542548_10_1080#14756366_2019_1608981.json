To avoid non-specific inhibition due to aggregate formation, all of the compounds were tested in the presence of detergent (0.005% Triton-X114). The data are presented as the residual activities of these Mur ligases in the presence of 100 µM of each test compound (Supporting Information Table S1). Compounds that showed residual activity <50% on at least two of these Mur ligases were considered as ‘hits’ (Supporting Information Table S1, gray). The IC50 values against MurC, D, E and F were determined for the selected hit compounds – one representative compound from each structural class was chosen: compound 133, aza-stilbene derivative; compound 234, alkynyl pyrimidine; compound 335, pyrazolo [1,5]-b]pyridazine; compound 436, phenoxypyrimidine; compound 537, 4,6-bis-anilino-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-pyrimidine (Table 1). The four hits (1, 2, 4, 5) inhibited all four of these Mur ligases in the micromolar range. Compound 3 only inhibited MurC, and was thus not investigated further. Among the hits, compounds for further mechanistic studies were chosen on the basis of their ligand efficiency. Ligand efficiency quantifies the molecular properties, particularly size and lipophilicity and is used as a selection criterion for structurally different compounds as more ‘efficient’ ligands have the potential to control for the inflation of these properties38 Thus ligand efficiencies were calculated for the four hits (Supporting Information Table S2)39,40, and compound 1 was selected as the most promising for additional studies. Additionally, regarding the data of profiled compounds in large panels of human kinase assays41 (Supporting Information Table S4), only hit compound 5 among our hits showed appreciable activity at human kinases, thus compound 1 was selected for the further evaluation. To provide sufficient amounts of compound 1 for kinetic and NMR studies, it was resynthesized according to the synthetic procedures (Figure 2) described in the literature33.",

To avoid non-specific inhibition due to aggregate formation, all of the compounds were tested in the presence of detergent (0.005% Triton-X114). The data are presented as the residual activities of these Mur ligases in the presence of 100 µM of each test compound (Supporting Information Table S1). Compounds that showed residual activity <50% on at least two of these Mur ligases were considered as ‘hits’ (Supporting Information Table S1, gray). The IC50 values against MurC, D, E and F were determined for the selected hit compounds – one representative compound from each structural class was chosen: compound 133, aza-stilbene derivative; compound 234, alkynyl pyrimidine; compound 335, pyrazolo [1,5]-b]pyridazine; compound 436, phenoxypyrimidine; compound 537, 4,6-bis-anilino-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-pyrimidine (Table 1). The four hits (1, 2, 4, 5) inhibited all four of these Mur ligases in the micromolar range. Compound 3 only inhibited MurC, and was thus not investigated further. Among the hits, compounds for further mechanistic studies were chosen on the basis of their ligand efficiency. Ligand efficiency quantifies the molecular properties, particularly size and lipophilicity and is used as a selection criterion for structurally different compounds as more ‘efficient’ ligands have the potential to control for the inflation of these properties38 Thus ligand efficiencies were calculated for the four hits (Supporting Information Table S2)39,40, and compound 1 was selected as the most promising for additional studies. Additionally, regarding the data of profiled compounds in large panels of human kinase assays41 (Supporting Information Table S4), only hit compound 5 among our hits showed appreciable activity at human kinases, thus compound 1 was selected for the further evaluation. To provide sufficient amounts of compound 1 for kinetic and NMR studies, it was resynthesized according to the synthetic procedures (Figure 2) described in the literature33.",
