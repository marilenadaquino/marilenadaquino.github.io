We added the newly reported PDB information of these structures in the Supporting Information.) These ligands were docked back into their corresponding protein structures using Gold5.1 (CCDCs software GOLD version 5.1)39,40, CDOCKER (DS 4.0)41, alpha PMI (Principal Moments of Inertia, MOE 2016.09)42, AutoDock43, and Glide (Schrödinger 2009)44. To define the binding pocket of IDO1 cocrystal structure, residues around the native ligand (radius set as 8.0 Å) were selected for molecular docking. All other parameters are set as default. The docking results were evaluated through comparison of the best docked poses and the real cocrystallised pose to measure docking reliability. The best docking pose was defined as that top-scoring poses. The docking software was evaluated with root mean square deviation (RMSD) value.",
