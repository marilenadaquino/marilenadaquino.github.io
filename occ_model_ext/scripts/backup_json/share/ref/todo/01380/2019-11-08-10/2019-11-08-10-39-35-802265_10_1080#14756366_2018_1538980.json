                "pl_string": "In the last decade, the importance of exosomes has gained attention for their role in intercellular communication. They are cell-derived nanovesicles (40–180 nm) shuttling proteins, DNA, and RNA that could be transferred to recipient cells and modulate their protein expression1,2. Exosomes membrane is composed of a lipid bilayer enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin (typically lipid rafts components3), in ceramide (essential for the insertion of microRNAs into exosomes4) and Bis (monoacylglycero) phosphate (BMP) (an exosome-specific marker5). Exosomes are released from cells in physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer. It has been demonstrated that cancer cells produce more exosomes as compared to normal cells, and cancer exosomes differ from normal exosomes in molecular composition and function6. The tumour microenvironment is acidic, a common feature of virtually all cancers7. The extracellular acidity has a strong influence on the tumour microenvironment fitness, with a critical role in the progressive microevolution of cancers, including the induction of increased exosome release7–10. Tumour pH ranges in vivo from 6 to 6.8, with a mean of 6.5 and it is correlated to tumour malignancy11–17. In addition to low pH, tumour microenvironment is characterised by hypoxia and low nutrients supply, and a typical sign of malignancy that is the so-called aerobic glycolysis, also called Warburg Effect, i.e. sugar fermentation in hypoxic condition7,18–21. These cells produce ATP converting glucose in lactic acid, rather than metabolising it in mitochondria through oxidative phosphorylation20,22–25. However, this process implies an increase of glucose absorption to sustain energy requirement by tumour cells. The most important product of tumour metabolism is lactate leading in turn to H+ accumulation in the extracellular microenvironment with a direct consequence of the low pH26. High levels of carbonic dioxide produced during mitochondrial respiration of oxygenated cancer cells also contribute to a substantial release of H+ into the tumour microenvironment27–32. Low extracellular pH, lactic and carbonic acid production, uncontrolled growth, low blood and nutrient supply, contribute to generate a tumour microenvironment extremely toxic to normal cells. The toxic microenvironment progressively selects malignant cells, able to survive in this adverse condition thanks to up-regulation of expression and activity of several proton extrusion mechanisms, which release protons and lactate into extracellular microenvironment avoiding cytosol acidification33,34. In fact, an anti-acidic approach based on either Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI)9,35 or buffers leads to acidification of cancer cell cytosol followed by quick and non-conventional cell death. Moreover, the anti-acidic treatment sensitises cancer cells to chemotherapeutics12,15,16, supporting the use of PPI as a new strategy against cancer36–38. Among proton flux regulator21 there are vacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPases), Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX)10,33,34, and Na+/HCO3 co-transporters (NBC)39. Interference (i.e. inhibition) with one or more of these proton pumps leads to a potent inhibition of cancer growth in a variety of ex vivo and in vivo models40–42. In this context, a pivotal role has been attributed to the CA IX, which is a metalloenzyme well studied in cancer. CA IX belongs to the α-CA genetic family among the seven CA-families known up to date. It is a membrane protein characterised by an extracellular proteoglycan domain, an extracellular catalytic domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short intracytosolic tail. Its primary function, like the other 14 human isoforms, is to catalyse the reaction of CO2 with H2O to produce H2CO3, which instantly dissociates to H+ and HCO3−. The promoter region of the gene (CA 9) encoding for CA IX contains a hypoxia-responsive element, with CA9 mRNA expression highly upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1)43. Hypoxic tumours express high amounts of CA IX yielding an increase of the intracellular concentration of HCO3− and extracellular acidification. The formed protons (H+) are secreted into the extracellular space through the pump/vacuolar-type ATPase and/or a Na+/H+ exchanger, while the HCO3− is shuttled back to the cytosol mostly via a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger, although other ion exchangers may be involved as well (for both proteins more isoforms are known, some of which present predominantly in tumours)44. Therefore, CA IX activity is one of the main players responsible for the extracellular acidity of hypoxic tumours. One CA IX inhibitor (SLC-0111) actually progressed to Phase Ib clinical trials for the treatment of hypoxic, metastatic tumours45,46. This study hypothesised that some of the proton exchangers, extremely active in malignant cancer cells, could be expressed on exosomes and actively modulated by the acidic conditions. To this purpose, we explored the expression and activity of CA IX in cancer cells and cancer-released exosomes showing that CA IX expression and related activity are up-regulated under the acidic condition in both cells and exosomes. These results support a key role of CA IX in cancer progression and as both a cancer biomarker and a therapeutic target.",

In this context, a pivotal role has been attributed to the CA IX, which is a metalloenzyme well studied in cancer. CA IX belongs to the α-CA genetic family among the seven CA-families known up to date. It is a membrane protein characterised by an extracellular proteoglycan domain, an extracellular catalytic domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short intracytosolic tail. Its primary function, like the other 14 human isoforms, is to catalyse the reaction of CO2 with H2O to produce H2CO3, which instantly dissociates to H+ and HCO3−. The promoter region of the gene (CA 9) encoding for CA IX contains a hypoxia-responsive element, with CA9 mRNA expression highly upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1)43. Hypoxic tumours express high amounts of CA IX yielding an increase of the intracellular concentration of HCO3− and extracellular acidification. The formed protons (H+) are secreted into the extracellular space through the pump/vacuolar-type ATPase and/or a Na+/H+ exchanger, while the HCO3− is shuttled back to the cytosol mostly via a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger, although other ion exchangers may be involved as well (for both proteins more isoforms are known, some of which present predominantly in tumours)44. Therefore, CA IX activity is one of the main players responsible for the extracellular acidity of hypoxic tumours. One CA IX inhibitor (SLC-0111) actually progressed to Phase Ib clinical trials for the treatment of hypoxic, metastatic tumours45,46. This study hypothesised that some of the proton exchangers, extremely active in malignant cancer cells, could be expressed on exosomes and actively modulated by the acidic conditions. To this purpose, we explored the expression and activity of CA IX in cancer cells and cancer-released exosomes showing that CA IX expression and related activity are up-regulated under the acidic condition in both cells and exosomes. These results support a key role of CA IX in cancer progression and as both a cancer biomarker and a therapeutic target.",

They are cell-derived nanovesicles (40–180 nm) shuttling proteins, DNA, and RNA that could be transferred to recipient cells and modulate their protein expression1,2. Exosomes membrane is composed of a lipid bilayer enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin (typically lipid rafts components3), in ceramide (essential for the insertion of microRNAs into exosomes4) and Bis (monoacylglycero) phosphate (BMP) (an exosome-specific marker5). Exosomes are released from cells in physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer. It has been demonstrated that cancer cells produce more exosomes as compared to normal cells, and cancer exosomes differ from normal exosomes in molecular composition and function6. The tumour microenvironment is acidic, a common feature of virtually all cancers7. The extracellular acidity has a strong influence on the tumour microenvironment fitness, with a critical role in the progressive microevolution of cancers, including the induction of increased exosome release7–10. Tumour pH ranges in vivo from 6 to 6.8, with a mean of 6.5 and it is correlated to tumour malignancy11–17. In addition to low pH, tumour microenvironment is characterised by hypoxia and low nutrients supply, and a typical sign of malignancy that is the so-called aerobic glycolysis, also called Warburg Effect, i.e. sugar fermentation in hypoxic condition7,18–21. These cells produce ATP converting glucose in lactic acid, rather than metabolising it in mitochondria through oxidative phosphorylation20,22–25. However, this process implies an increase of glucose absorption to sustain energy requirement by tumour cells. The most important product of tumour metabolism is lactate leading in turn to H+ accumulation in the extracellular microenvironment with a direct consequence of the low pH26. High levels of carbonic dioxide produced during mitochondrial respiration of oxygenated cancer cells also contribute to a substantial release of H+ into the tumour microenvironment27–32. Low extracellular pH, lactic and carbonic acid production, uncontrolled growth, low blood and nutrient supply, contribute to generate a tumour microenvironment extremely toxic to normal cells. The toxic microenvironment progressively selects malignant cells, able to survive in this adverse condition thanks to up-regulation of expression and activity of several proton extrusion mechanisms, which release protons and lactate into extracellular microenvironment avoiding cytosol acidification33,34. In fact, an anti-acidic approach based on either Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI)9,35 or buffers leads to acidification of cancer cell cytosol followed by quick and non-conventional cell death.

                "pl_string": "In the last decade, the importance of exosomes has gained attention for their role in intercellular communication. They are cell-derived nanovesicles (40–180 nm) shuttling proteins, DNA, and RNA that could be transferred to recipient cells and modulate their protein expression1,2. Exosomes membrane is composed of a lipid bilayer enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin (typically lipid rafts components3), in ceramide (essential for the insertion of microRNAs into exosomes4) and Bis (monoacylglycero) phosphate (BMP) (an exosome-specific marker5). Exosomes are released from cells in physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer. It has been demonstrated that cancer cells produce more exosomes as compared to normal cells, and cancer exosomes differ from normal exosomes in molecular composition and function6. The tumour microenvironment is acidic, a common feature of virtually all cancers7. The extracellular acidity has a strong influence on the tumour microenvironment fitness, with a critical role in the progressive microevolution of cancers, including the induction of increased exosome release7–10. Tumour pH ranges in vivo from 6 to 6.8, with a mean of 6.5 and it is correlated to tumour malignancy11–17. In addition to low pH, tumour microenvironment is characterised by hypoxia and low nutrients supply, and a typical sign of malignancy that is the so-called aerobic glycolysis, also called Warburg Effect, i.e. sugar fermentation in hypoxic condition7,18–21. These cells produce ATP converting glucose in lactic acid, rather than metabolising it in mitochondria through oxidative phosphorylation20,22–25. However, this process implies an increase of glucose absorption to sustain energy requirement by tumour cells. The most important product of tumour metabolism is lactate leading in turn to H+ accumulation in the extracellular microenvironment with a direct consequence of the low pH26. High levels of carbonic dioxide produced during mitochondrial respiration of oxygenated cancer cells also contribute to a substantial release of H+ into the tumour microenvironment27–32. Low extracellular pH, lactic and carbonic acid production, uncontrolled growth, low blood and nutrient supply, contribute to generate a tumour microenvironment extremely toxic to normal cells. The toxic microenvironment progressively selects malignant cells, able to survive in this adverse condition thanks to up-regulation of expression and activity of several proton extrusion mechanisms, which release protons and lactate into extracellular microenvironment avoiding cytosol acidification33,34. In fact, an anti-acidic approach based on either Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI)9,35 or buffers leads to acidification of cancer cell cytosol followed by quick and non-conventional cell death. Moreover, the anti-acidic treatment sensitises cancer cells to chemotherapeutics12,15,16, supporting the use of PPI as a new strategy against cancer36–38. Among proton flux regulator21 there are vacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPases), Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX)10,33,34, and Na+/HCO3 co-transporters (NBC)39. Interference (i.e. inhibition) with one or more of these proton pumps leads to a potent inhibition of cancer growth in a variety of ex vivo and in vivo models40–42. In this context, a pivotal role has been attributed to the CA IX, which is a metalloenzyme well studied in cancer. CA IX belongs to the α-CA genetic family among the seven CA-families known up to date. It is a membrane protein characterised by an extracellular proteoglycan domain, an extracellular catalytic domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short intracytosolic tail. Its primary function, like the other 14 human isoforms, is to catalyse the reaction of CO2 with H2O to produce H2CO3, which instantly dissociates to H+ and HCO3−. The promoter region of the gene (CA 9) encoding for CA IX contains a hypoxia-responsive element, with CA9 mRNA expression highly upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1)43. Hypoxic tumours express high amounts of CA IX yielding an increase of the intracellular concentration of HCO3− and extracellular acidification. The formed protons (H+) are secreted into the extracellular space through the pump/vacuolar-type ATPase and/or a Na+/H+ exchanger, while the HCO3− is shuttled back to the cytosol mostly via a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger, although other ion exchangers may be involved as well (for both proteins more isoforms are known, some of which present predominantly in tumours)44. Therefore, CA IX activity is one of the main players responsible for the extracellular acidity of hypoxic tumours. One CA IX inhibitor (SLC-0111) actually progressed to Phase Ib clinical trials for the treatment of hypoxic, metastatic tumours45,46. This study hypothesised that some of the proton exchangers, extremely active in malignant cancer cells, could be expressed on exosomes and actively modulated by the acidic conditions. To this purpose, we explored the expression and activity of CA IX in cancer cells and cancer-released exosomes showing that CA IX expression and related activity are up-regulated under the acidic condition in both cells and exosomes. These results support a key role of CA IX in cancer progression and as both a cancer biomarker and a therapeutic target.",

The results showed different expression of CA IX in cells cultured in the acidic media (pH 6.5) respect to those at pH 7.4. The obtained results were consistent with the previous data showing that the low-pH is the most suitable condition for CA IX catalysis49–51. Moreover, the Confocal Analysis showed a remarkable expression of the protein in the cytoplasm of the cells cultured in the acidic microenvironment, with different internal distribution, suggesting that acidity influences CA IX expression and localisation within tumour cells. Notably, the CA IX expression in exosomes lysates reflected the CA IX expression at the cellular level in both acidic and physiological conditions. In addition, WB Analysis evidenced that the expression of the CA IX 54 kDa band increased in acidic condition at both cellular and exosome levels. All these experiments support the CA IX role in the in vivo tumour condition, since CA IX expression increased with progressive acidification and decreased with alkalinisation at both cellular and exosome levels. Thus, the tumour acidic microenvironment is the key factor in influencing the CA IX expression and activity in cancer cells and cancer-released exosomes. Previous reports have shown that CA IX is related to cancer development and progression66 and some malignant cancer activities such as cell spreading and migration67. Therefore, the possibility to obtain exosomes from plasma samples of tumour patients may offer the opportunity to consider CA IX a key tumour biomarker. Considering that CA IX is involved in the metastatic activity of cancer cells52,68, measuring its expression and activity in the exosomes may be helpful in monitoring cancer patients, as we have shown here for prostate cancer. Lastly, having exosomes a pivotal role in the metastatic process, both in preparing a metastatic niche and in inducing a tumour-like transformation in mesenchymal stem cells in target organs60, it is highly conceivable that the expression and activity of CA IX in tumour exosomes may be the key factor in the spreading of cancer all over the body. In conclusion, the future of anti-tumour strategies in primary cancers should be focussed in inhibiting the exosomes release and CA IX expression in malignant cancers.
