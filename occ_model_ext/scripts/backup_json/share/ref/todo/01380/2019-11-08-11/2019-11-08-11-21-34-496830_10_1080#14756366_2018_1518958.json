Arylcoumarin was discovered in abundance existence in some plants. Later on, scientists conducted a lot of syntheses and activity experiments on the basis of the natural structure of arylcoumarins by splitting and derivatisation1–3. Among them, the research on 3-arylcoumarins received great attention. Studies have shown that arylcoumarins exhibit a variety of activities, such as anti-cancer4, anti-leukemia5, anticoagulant, anti-allergic6, anti-inflammatory7, antioxidant8, antimicrobial9–11, estrogen receptor affinity12, adenosine receptor affinity7, and monoamine oxidase B inhibition activity13,14. Rich pharmacological activity has stimulated interest in the research of arylcoumarins. These compounds have similarities in chemical structure with coumarins, flavones, isoflavones, and trans-stilbenes and they are related to each other in the process of biosynthesis in plants15. Therefore, they are highly regarded by researchers. Isoflavones, the most abundant phytoestrogens in soy beans, are structurally similar to 3-arylcoumarin derivatives. The compounds have been found effective in the management of diabetes by acting on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors16. Researchers found that resveratrol appears a good candidate as a neutraceutical support for the therapy of obesity and type II diabetes17,18. In recent years, coumarins and flavonoids have received wide attention owing to their excellent advanced glycation end products (AGEs) inhibitory and anti-inflammatory activities19,20.

Arylcoumarin was discovered in abundance existence in some plants. Later on, scientists conducted a lot of syntheses and activity experiments on the basis of the natural structure of arylcoumarins by splitting and derivatisation1–3. Among them, the research on 3-arylcoumarins received great attention. Studies have shown that arylcoumarins exhibit a variety of activities, such as anti-cancer4, anti-leukemia5, anticoagulant, anti-allergic6, anti-inflammatory7, antioxidant8, antimicrobial9–11, estrogen receptor affinity12, adenosine receptor affinity7, and monoamine oxidase B inhibition activity13,14. Rich pharmacological activity has stimulated interest in the research of arylcoumarins. These compounds have similarities in chemical structure with coumarins, flavones, isoflavones, and trans-stilbenes and they are related to each other in the process of biosynthesis in plants15. Therefore, they are highly regarded by researchers. Isoflavones, the most abundant phytoestrogens in soy beans, are structurally similar to 3-arylcoumarin derivatives. The compounds have been found effective in the management of diabetes by acting on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors16. Researchers found that resveratrol appears a good candidate as a neutraceutical support for the therapy of obesity and type II diabetes17,18. In recent years, coumarins and flavonoids have received wide attention owing to their excellent advanced glycation end products (AGEs) inhibitory and anti-inflammatory activities19,20. Minpei Kuroda et al.21 reported that 3-arylcoumarins have the effect of significantly decreasing the blood glucose levels of genetically diabetic mice. Antioxidant compounds, its free radical scavenger properties imply a protective effect against oxidative stress in the early stages of diabetic nephropathy, leading to symptom relief and improvement in organ function.
