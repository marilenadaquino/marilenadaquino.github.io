Introduction of the bulky benzoyl moiety in the side chain of compound 1 led to a compound endowed with different features, including a remarkable stability towards GSH under physiological conditions17. Unfortunately, compound 3, like several other carboxyl ester linkage-containing compounds, is highly susceptible to hydrolysis catalysed by CES29 (see panels A and C of Figure 7), a feature limiting its availability in biological systems. However, the isosteric replacement of the carboxyl ester linkage of 3 with an amide moiety was successful in improving the stability to metabolic hydrolysis. Indeed, compound 4, the amide analog of 3, was found to be quite stable to human liver microsomal esterases (panel B, Figure 7). Interestingly, the adopted isosteric replacement completely changed the pattern of inhibition of GSTP1-1 catalytic activity; compound 4, like 1, was able to fully abolish the enzymatic activity of GSTP1-1, while compound 3 inhibited enzyme activity no more than 50% (Figure 5). Molecular docking orientations obtained for 3 within the GSTP1-1 active site showed, among the clusters with the most favourable binding energies, a pose in which the benzoyl ring of 3 is placed at the interface between the protein monomers, in close proximity with the side chain of Tyr 4917. It is possible to speculate that this binding mode could account for the half-site inhibition of GSTP1-1 observed in the presence of 3. However, the very similar binding pose and energy found also for 4 suggest a more complex enzyme inhibition mechanism that cannot be inferable from the static picture provided by docking. Nevertheless, compound 4 was still capable of affecting formation of the TRAF2-GSTP1-1 complex even in the absence of GSH (Figure 6). These findings suggest that the presence of the ester oxygen atom is not a structural requisite to interfere with the interaction between TRAF2 and GSTP1-1. The highest affinity poses of 3 and 4 show the terminal benzoyl moiety in close contact with the hydrophobic Phe 8 residue. The steric hindrance of the benzoyl moiety in that position can account very well for the restricted mobility of helix 2 of GSTP1-1, which was demonstrated to be crucial for TRAF2 binding30. Similar poses are found in the high scoring results of docking on the Apo-GST structures, thus explaining the inhibition of TRAF2-GSTP1-1 binding even in the absence of GSH. The lack of influence of GSH on the ability of compound 4 to disrupt the interaction between TRAF2 and GSTP1-1 is a relevant feature since GSH levels fluctuate in healthy mammalian organs31,32, in several human tumours3, as well as in the brain of patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders15.",

Introduction of the bulky benzoyl moiety in the side chain of compound 1 led to a compound endowed with different features, including a remarkable stability towards GSH under physiological conditions17. Unfortunately, compound 3, like several other carboxyl ester linkage-containing compounds, is highly susceptible to hydrolysis catalysed by CES29 (see panels A and C of Figure 7), a feature limiting its availability in biological systems. However, the isosteric replacement of the carboxyl ester linkage of 3 with an amide moiety was successful in improving the stability to metabolic hydrolysis. Indeed, compound 4, the amide analog of 3, was found to be quite stable to human liver microsomal esterases (panel B, Figure 7). Interestingly, the adopted isosteric replacement completely changed the pattern of inhibition of GSTP1-1 catalytic activity; compound 4, like 1, was able to fully abolish the enzymatic activity of GSTP1-1, while compound 3 inhibited enzyme activity no more than 50% (Figure 5). Molecular docking orientations obtained for 3 within the GSTP1-1 active site showed, among the clusters with the most favourable binding energies, a pose in which the benzoyl ring of 3 is placed at the interface between the protein monomers, in close proximity with the side chain of Tyr 4917. It is possible to speculate that this binding mode could account for the half-site inhibition of GSTP1-1 observed in the presence of 3. However, the very similar binding pose and energy found also for 4 suggest a more complex enzyme inhibition mechanism that cannot be inferable from the static picture provided by docking. Nevertheless, compound 4 was still capable of affecting formation of the TRAF2-GSTP1-1 complex even in the absence of GSH (Figure 6). These findings suggest that the presence of the ester oxygen atom is not a structural requisite to interfere with the interaction between TRAF2 and GSTP1-1. The highest affinity poses of 3 and 4 show the terminal benzoyl moiety in close contact with the hydrophobic Phe 8 residue. The steric hindrance of the benzoyl moiety in that position can account very well for the restricted mobility of helix 2 of GSTP1-1, which was demonstrated to be crucial for TRAF2 binding30. Similar poses are found in the high scoring results of docking on the Apo-GST structures, thus explaining the inhibition of TRAF2-GSTP1-1 binding even in the absence of GSH. The lack of influence of GSH on the ability of compound 4 to disrupt the interaction between TRAF2 and GSTP1-1 is a relevant feature since GSH levels fluctuate in healthy mammalian organs31,32, in several human tumours3, as well as in the brain of patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders15.",
