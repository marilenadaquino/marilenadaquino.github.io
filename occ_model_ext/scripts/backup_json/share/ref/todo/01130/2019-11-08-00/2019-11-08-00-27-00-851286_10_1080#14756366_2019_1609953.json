Since then, thousands of oximes, including the commercial bis-pyridinium aldoximes obidoxime and asoxime (HI-6), have been synthesized and evaluated. However, all these molecules were designed with the sole purpose of entering and removing the OP from the active site of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is responsible for the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), and also the main molecular target of the OPs2,4. Recently a new approach in the design of antidotes against OPs has proposed the design of novel prophylactic enzymatic reactivators through the conjugation of the 4-pyridine aldoxime (4-PA) to a peripheral site ligand (PSL) capable of binding to the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE2,5. Nepovimova et al.6 designed a novel hybrid reactivator bearing 7-methoxytacrine (7-MEOTA) as a PSL linked to 4-PA through a 5-carbon spacer (Figure 1). Ideally, this drug, named hybrid 5C by Nepovimova et al.6, would act in a prophylactic reversible inhibition of human AChE (HssAChE) thanks to the occupancy of the 7-MEOTA moiety at the PAS, and the action of the 4-PA moiety in the catalytic anionic site (CAS; Figure 2). In case intoxication occurs, the 4-PA fragment would reactivate the phosphorylated HssAChE, acting as an antidote6. Figure 1 summarizes former experimental results through in vitro tests regarding the reactivation of VX-inhibited HssAChE versus HssAChE inhibition by hybrid 5C6,8. This compound was evaluated together with the commercial reactivators 2-PAM and obidoxime, as well as 4-PA (Figure 1). According to Nepovimova et al.6, even though the 7-MEOTA moiety has a relatively strong capacity of enzymatic inhibition, hybrid 5C was capable of reactivating VX-inhibited HssAChE better than obidoxime.",

Some atomic mass and OPLS/AA parameters data of such output topology files were corrected by the MKTOP algorithm40. Short-range vdW and electrostatic interactions were considered up to a cutoff = 1.0 nm and long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method41. The systems were subjected to energy minimizations to accommodate the water molecules and avoid overlapping of vdW radius. As before42–44, different algorithms with a maximum of 20,000 steps each one, were used as follows: two steepest descent minimizations, one with position restriction (STPR) up to a maximum force of 104.6 kJ mol−1 nm−1 and another without PR (ST) up to 209.2 kJ mol−1 nm−1; conjugate gradients (CG) minimization, up to 104.6 kJ mol−1 nm−1; and L-BFGS, a quasi-Newton–Raphson-based method, up to 41.84 kJ mol−1 nm−1. After, the isothermal-isochoric (NVT) and the subsequent isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensembles were simulated to equilibrate pressure and volume of the system. Physiologic conditions were considered with T = 37 °C and P = 100 kPa, PR for the inhibited protein, leap-frog integrator, V-rescale thermostat modified from Berendsen45 for temperature coupling, Parrinello–Rahman barostat46 for pressure coupling, 2 fs of integration step, and 100 ps of simulation. Finally, the systems were subjected to 500 ps of MD simulation with PR for all atoms, except the water molecules, to ensure a balance of the solvent around the protein, and then, followed by 50 ns of MD production without restraints. Such MD simulations were run with leap-frog integrator, 2 fs of integration step, and V-rescale thermostat. Trajectories and energy data of the whole system and all its particles were obtained at every 100 ps of simulation to calculate properties such as total energy, RMSD, average number of H-bonds, and atomic distances.
