Compounds such as p53 disruptors (tenovin-1)2 and inhibitors of XIAP (GDC-0152)3 or Bcl-2 (ABT-199)4 act directly on proteins in the apoptotic pathway to induce apoptosis and lead to the death of cancer cells. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases enzymes important for maintaining homeostasis through regulating cell death. A number of studies have demonstrated that direct activation of procaspase-3 by small molecules could have advantages over the above apoptosis-inducing compounds, because procaspase-3 is found overexpressed in various human tumours, including those of colon cancer5, lung cancer6, melanoma7, hepatoma8, breast cancer9, lymphoma10, and neuroblastoma11.",
