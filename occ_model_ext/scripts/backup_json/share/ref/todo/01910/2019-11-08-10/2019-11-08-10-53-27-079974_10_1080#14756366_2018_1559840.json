                "pl_string": "The physiologic/biosynthetic processes requiring CO2 or HCO3− (respiration, photosynthesis/gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, ureagenesis, carboxylation) and biochemical pathways involving pH homeostasis, secretion of electrolytes, calcification, bone resorption, transport of CO2, and bicarbonate, etc., are connected with the interconversion of CO2 to bicarbonate and protons (CO2 + H2O ⇌ HCO3− + H+)1,2. In all living organism, the CO2 hydration/dehydration reaction is catalysed by a superfamily of ubiquitous metalloenzymes, known as carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1)3–10, which catalyse these reactions at very high rates, with a pseudo-first order kinetic constant (kcat) ranging from 104 to 106 s−1 for the CO2 hydration11,12. At the intracellular concentrations of CO2, the uncatalysed CO2 hydration/dehydration reaction has a too low rate with an effective kcat of 0.15 s−1 for the hydration reaction, and a rate constant of 50 s−1 for the reverse reaction11,12. CAs have thus the physiologically pivotal role to accelerate the CO2 hydration/dehydration reaction significantly, in order to support the fast processes involving dissolved inorganic carbon, which otherwise would be impaired without these enzymes13. In this context, CAs started to be investigated in detail in pathogenic, as well as non-pathogenic organisms recently, since it has been demonstrated that CAs are essential for the life cycle of bacteria, fungi and protozoa4,9,13–20. For example, fungal β-CAs plays a critical role in the CO2-sensing and in the regulation of sexual development of many fungal organisms20. Plasmodium falciparum, which is a protozoan, uses its η-CA for producing HCO3−, which is the substrate of the first enzyme involved in the pyrimidine pathway and necessary for DNA/RNA synthesis during the exponential growth and replication or the parasite4,21. Again, the growth of two non-pathogenic bacteria Ralstonia eutropha (its genome encodes for one periplasmic ɑ-CA, two β-CAs, and one ɣCA) and Escherichia coli (its genome contains one β-CA and one ɣ-CA) is strictly correlated to the CA activity22,23. The two CAs (ɑ and β) encoded in the genome of the pathogen Helicobacter pylori, are essential for the acid acclimation and the survival of the pathogen within the human stomach24–26; Vibrio cholerae uses its CAs (ɑ, β and ɣ) for producing sodium bicarbonate, which is an inducer of the cholera toxin gene expression27–32. The two pathogenic bacteria, Brucella suis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, need functional CAs for growing33–38. It is readily apparent that CAs from pathogens are potential drug targets and their inhibition leads to growth impairment or growth defects of the microorganism. Fortunately, many CA inhibitors (CAI) exists, which could be classified as inhibitors binding the metal ion (anion, sulphonamides and their bioisosteres, dithiocarbamates, xanthates); inhibitors anchoring to the water molecule/hydroxide ion coordinated to the metal (phenols, polyamines, thioxocoumarins, sulphocumarins); inhibitors occluding the active site entrance (coumarins and their isosteres) and inhibitors binding out of the active site39. As described in the literature, the principal drawback using CAIs as antiinfectives agents is the lack of selectivity towards the pathogenic versus human isoforms40–43. For this reason, many research groups are continually involved in the synthesis of new CAIs or in the modification/optimisation of the existing inhibitors, which are commonly tested on CAs from mammalian and pathogenic organisms11,13–15,20,44–46. Another critical issue is related to the inhibitor penetrability into microbial cells. Many CAIs are very efficient inhibitors when tested in vitro on the purified enzymes (inhibitors with a nanomolar KI) but showed ineffective in vivo results when tested on the microorganisms38,47,48. Since it is very complicated to obtain specific control measures and containment levels for activities with pathogenic organisms, in this article, we propose the marine unicellular diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum as a model organism for testing the membrane penetrability of the CAIs. P. tricornutum is a eukaryotic organism characterised by fusiform cells with a cell wall poor in silica49,50. The genome of the P. tricornutum encodes for nine CAs: five α-CAs confined in the matrices of the four-layered plastid membranes, two β-CAs (PtCA1 and PtCA2) located in the pyrenoid and two mitochondrial γ-CAs49. Recently, in the lumen of the pyrenoid-penetrating thylakoid a new class of CAs, named θ-CA, has been identified49. The CA inhibition of marine diatoms, as well as of other microalgae, lead to growth impairment or defects in the microalga because these enzymes have a pivotal role in ensuring the supply of inorganic carbon (Ci) to RuBisCO and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase49,51.",

Again, the growth of two non-pathogenic bacteria Ralstonia eutropha (its genome encodes for one periplasmic ɑ-CA, two β-CAs, and one ɣCA) and Escherichia coli (its genome contains one β-CA and one ɣ-CA) is strictly correlated to the CA activity22,23. The two CAs (ɑ and β) encoded in the genome of the pathogen Helicobacter pylori, are essential for the acid acclimation and the survival of the pathogen within the human stomach24–26; Vibrio cholerae uses its CAs (ɑ, β and ɣ) for producing sodium bicarbonate, which is an inducer of the cholera toxin gene expression27–32. The two pathogenic bacteria, Brucella suis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, need functional CAs for growing33–38. It is readily apparent that CAs from pathogens are potential drug targets and their inhibition leads to growth impairment or growth defects of the microorganism. Fortunately, many CA inhibitors (CAI) exists, which could be classified as inhibitors binding the metal ion (anion, sulphonamides and their bioisosteres, dithiocarbamates, xanthates); inhibitors anchoring to the water molecule/hydroxide ion coordinated to the metal (phenols, polyamines, thioxocoumarins, sulphocumarins); inhibitors occluding the active site entrance (coumarins and their isosteres) and inhibitors binding out of the active site39. As described in the literature, the principal drawback using CAIs as antiinfectives agents is the lack of selectivity towards the pathogenic versus human isoforms40–43. For this reason, many research groups are continually involved in the synthesis of new CAIs or in the modification/optimisation of the existing inhibitors, which are commonly tested on CAs from mammalian and pathogenic organisms11,13–15,20,44–46. Another critical issue is related to the inhibitor penetrability into microbial cells. Many CAIs are very efficient inhibitors when tested in vitro on the purified enzymes (inhibitors with a nanomolar KI) but showed ineffective in vivo results when tested on the microorganisms38,47,48. Since it is very complicated to obtain specific control measures and containment levels for activities with pathogenic organisms, in this article, we propose the marine unicellular diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum as a model organism for testing the membrane penetrability of the CAIs. P. tricornutum is a eukaryotic organism characterised by fusiform cells with a cell wall poor in silica49,50. The genome of the P. tricornutum encodes for nine CAs: five α-CAs confined in the matrices of the four-layered plastid membranes, two β-CAs (PtCA1 and PtCA2) located in the pyrenoid and two mitochondrial γ-CAs49. Recently, in the lumen of the pyrenoid-penetrating thylakoid a new class of CAs, named θ-CA, has been identified49. The CA inhibition of marine diatoms, as well as of other microalgae, lead to growth impairment or defects in the microalga because these enzymes have a pivotal role in ensuring the supply of inorganic carbon (Ci) to RuBisCO and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase49,51.",

In all living organism, the CO2 hydration/dehydration reaction is catalysed by a superfamily of ubiquitous metalloenzymes, known as carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1)3–10, which catalyse these reactions at very high rates, with a pseudo-first order kinetic constant (kcat) ranging from 104 to 106 s−1 for the CO2 hydration11,12. At the intracellular concentrations of CO2, the uncatalysed CO2 hydration/dehydration reaction has a too low rate with an effective kcat of 0.15 s−1 for the hydration reaction, and a rate constant of 50 s−1 for the reverse reaction11,12. CAs have thus the physiologically pivotal role to accelerate the CO2 hydration/dehydration reaction significantly, in order to support the fast processes involving dissolved inorganic carbon, which otherwise would be impaired without these enzymes13. In this context, CAs started to be investigated in detail in pathogenic, as well as non-pathogenic organisms recently, since it has been demonstrated that CAs are essential for the life cycle of bacteria, fungi and protozoa4,9,13–20. For example, fungal β-CAs plays a critical role in the CO2-sensing and in the regulation of sexual development of many fungal organisms20.
