Eleven isoforms of deacetylases (HDAC 1–11) which constitute the classical family, share similar structure, and require Zn2+ for their activity onset. While the sirtuin family contains 7 isoforms (SIRT 1–7), which are structurally different from the classical family, and they are NAD-dependent16,17. HDACs are deregulated in different cancer types,8 however, the intricate physiological role of HDAC and its involvement in normal cell proliferation18, mitosis, 19 development, cardiac morphogenesis20, signal transduction pathways21,22, and apoptosis19,23–25 made pan inhibition of HDACs leads to exhibition of toxicity26–30. Researchers worked extensively on providing structural determinants for the generation of selective or even preferential inhibitors against one isoform12,31–33 or group of isoforms13,34,35. Selective HDAC inhibition reduces the toxicity that results from complete shutdown of normal physiological functions of HDACs due to pan inhibition. It was reported that the zinc-dependent HDAC isoforms require an inhibitor with the following characterisations: hydrophobic cap, metal deter and a linker to link between the metal deter and the cap36. Only HDAC6 and HDAC8 that can accommodate large hydrophobic cap due to the presence of a second tube-like pocket with a different shape and close to the active hydrophobic pocket37,38 when compared to the other isoforms, but the difference between HDAC6 and HDAC8 is the protein surface flexibility that was identified as a factor of selectivity36. The other isoforms are closely similar and the elaboration of selective inhibitors against them is yet, very limited and not feasible to achieve36. Thus, many selective inhibitors that were discovered where almost against HDAC6 and/or HDAC8 due to the distinct protein structural differences between these two specific isoforms and other isoforms.",

The linker properties regarding the length and saturation/unsaturation varied from structure to another, and ZBG group was conserved with all the reported structures57. Tubacin that is the first reported as potent selective HDAC6 inhibitor (HDAC6 IC50  = 4 nM)55,56; however, it has never been able to be tested in vivo due to its complex structure and high lipophilicity44. Rocillinostat; although it is the considered the first selective inhibitor of HDAC6, which is orally available and has moved to phase I/II of clinical trials for treating multiple myeloma as well as lymphoma58–60, its potency in solid tumours is very low as a single agent61 and has not been extensively investigated. Tubastatin A was reported as selective HDAC6 inhibitor with neuroprotective activity56 and no study proved its potential antiproliferative activity against any type of cancer, but it increased the sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to cisplatin62. Furthermore, Tubastatin A is of rigid tertahydro-γ-carboline hydrophobic cap that is not accessible to introduce different variables to develop but ring extension31. This gap encouraged scientists to initiate serious attempts to identify new HDAC6 selective inhibitors to combat specific types of cancer. Accordingly, we aimed at generating a lead compound that initially performs preferential HDAC6 inhibition, with new chemical entity, and is feasible to be synthesised and developed. Enzymatic assay against all human HDAC isoforms are going to be conducted to determine the preferential inhibition activity of the synthesised compounds, which will be coupled with the cytotoxic activity against specific type of children brain cancer; primary choroid plexus carcinoma (CCHE-45) and cell-based assays for detection of acetylated α-tubulin.",

This gap encouraged scientists to initiate serious attempts to identify new HDAC6 selective inhibitors to combat specific types of cancer.
