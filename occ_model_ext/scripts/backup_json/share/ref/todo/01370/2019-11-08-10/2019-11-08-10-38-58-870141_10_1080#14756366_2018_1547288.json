Thus, alternative chemotypes for a diverse approach to CA inhibition were developed1–7. One of them was that of obtaining coordination compounds in which the sulfonamides act as ligands to various transition or main group metal ions, leading to sulfonamide metal complexes11. Originally investigated for obtaining transition metal ion complexes of acetazolamide AAZ, methazolamide MZA and ethoxzolamide EZA (the main sulfonamide, clinically used drugs belonging to this class of pharmacological agents)11, this approach was subsequently extended to a large set of primary and secondary aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides, also including the clinical drugs saccharin (SAC), brinzolamide (BRZ) and dorzolamide (DRZ)12–17.
