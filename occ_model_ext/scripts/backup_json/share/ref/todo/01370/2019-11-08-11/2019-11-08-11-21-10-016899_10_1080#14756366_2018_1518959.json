It is possible to conclude that expansion of the series towards the para position of the phenyl ring, unless carried out with small groups, is detrimental for the activity of the compounds. To increase the polarity of the molecule, substitution of the C2 phenyl ring with a pyridine showed to be a more fruitful strategy, with high affinity toward both isoforms (compound 5, KdOASS-A = 0.4 μM, KdOASS-B = 6.1 μM). Even though the carboxylic acid group is essential for the binding to OASS13,27,28, its scarce diffusion across biological membranes is a well-known issue32,33. Therefore, to preserve the key interactions with the target, we carried out the replacement of the carboxylic acid by several isosters (Scheme 2). Substitution with a sulphonamide led to molecules unable to elicit significant changes in the fluorescence emission of the cofactor, potentially indicating that the compounds did not bind to the active site of the enzyme. This prompted us to further investigate the mechanism of inhibition of these molecules, since the residual activity at saturating concentrations is significant (about 40 − 50%, Figure 3, panel A). The molecules are poorly soluble in the buffer used for activity assays, compound 24 having a solubility limit of about 250 μM and compound 25 of about 50 μM. This hampers the accurate determination of the inhibition mechanism due to limitations to the range of inhibitor concentration that can be explored. However, since partial inhibition is a typical feature of allosteric inhibitors, we used a method developed by our group24 to assess if compound 25 is able to displace a low affinity active site binder, 1-ethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, that forms a highly fluorescent complex with OASS. Compound 25 is unable to displace the compound up to an equimolar concentration of about 200 μM. This is a strong indication that compound 25 is not able to compete for binding to the active site with 1-ethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. Therefore, either the dissociation constant of compound 25 for OASS-B is much higher than 170 μM (the Kd of 1-ethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid for OASS-B) or compound 25 does not bind to the active site of the enzyme (Figure 3, panel B). Unfortunately, replacement of the carboxylic acid by a tetrazole resulted in the decrease of the binding affinity (compound 29, KdOASS-A = 90 μM). Additional derivatization of the carboxylic acid group to deliver a small series of amides (compounds 16–22) was attempted as well in order to gain further insights into the anchoring groups that can be tolerated by StOASS. Either unsubstituted or substituted amides, regardless of the moiety attached to the nitrogen atom, had in general a detrimental effect on the binding constant. Rather surprisingly, the good activity of the tertiary amide 16 (compound 16, IC50 OASS-A = 17.2 μM) represents an exception to the SAR information collected. Indeed, from the bulk of experimental data so far described, it can be speculated that carboxylic acid replacement is tolerable if at that position the presence of a sharable hydrogen is granted. By contrast, the lack of a hydrogen for H-bond formation in compound 16 makes difficult its collocation within the SAR. With the help of computational methods, further efforts on the study of the mechanism of binding for this molecule will help in the explanation of this odd result.",

The molecules are poorly soluble in the buffer used for activity assays, compound 24 having a solubility limit of about 250 μM and compound 25 of about 50 μM. This hampers the accurate determination of the inhibition mechanism due to limitations to the range of inhibitor concentration that can be explored. However, since partial inhibition is a typical feature of allosteric inhibitors, we used a method developed by our group24 to assess if compound 25 is able to displace a low affinity active site binder, 1-ethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, that forms a highly fluorescent complex with OASS. Compound 25 is unable to displace the compound up to an equimolar concentration of about 200 μM. This is a strong indication that compound 25 is not able to compete for binding to the active site with 1-ethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. Therefore, either the dissociation constant of compound 25 for OASS-B is much higher than 170 μM (the Kd of 1-ethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid for OASS-B) or compound 25 does not bind to the active site of the enzyme (Figure 3, panel B). Unfortunately, replacement of the carboxylic acid by a tetrazole resulted in the decrease of the binding affinity (compound 29, KdOASS-A = 90 μM). Additional derivatization of the carboxylic acid group to deliver a small series of amides (compounds 16–22) was attempted as well in order to gain further insights into the anchoring groups that can be tolerated by StOASS. Either unsubstituted or substituted amides, regardless of the moiety attached to the nitrogen atom, had in general a detrimental effect on the binding constant. Rather surprisingly, the good activity of the tertiary amide 16 (compound 16, IC50 OASS-A = 17.2 μM) represents an exception to the SAR information collected. Indeed, from the bulk of experimental data so far described, it can be speculated that carboxylic acid replacement is tolerable if at that position the presence of a sharable hydrogen is granted. By contrast, the lack of a hydrogen for H-bond formation in compound 16 makes difficult its collocation within the SAR. With the help of computational methods, further efforts on the study of the mechanism of binding for this molecule will help in the explanation of this odd result.",

It is possible to conclude that expansion of the series towards the para position of the phenyl ring, unless carried out with small groups, is detrimental for the activity of the compounds. To increase the polarity of the molecule, substitution of the C2 phenyl ring with a pyridine showed to be a more fruitful strategy, with high affinity toward both isoforms (compound 5, KdOASS-A = 0.4 μM, KdOASS-B = 6.1 μM). Even though the carboxylic acid group is essential for the binding to OASS13,27,28, its scarce diffusion across biological membranes is a well-known issue32,33. Therefore, to preserve the key interactions with the target, we carried out the replacement of the carboxylic acid by several isosters (Scheme 2). Substitution with a sulphonamide led to molecules unable to elicit significant changes in the fluorescence emission of the cofactor, potentially indicating that the compounds did not bind to the active site of the enzyme.
