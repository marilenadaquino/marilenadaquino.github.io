Particularly relevant to the present study are the disulphide substrate analogues: e.g. alkyl 2-imidazolyl disulphides 1–38 (2, whose Ki value toward the enzyme was determined as 31 µM, is also known as PX-12 and has been in Phase 1 clinical trials for advanced metastatic cancer and was stopped due to safety concerns6), disodium 2,2′-dithio-bis-ethane sulphonate 49 (also known as TravoceptTM which advanced through phase III clinical trials in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and has a Km value of 72 µM6) as well as bicyclic disulphide-containing natural products chaetocin (5), gliotoxin (6) and chaetomin (7) which have been shown to possess Km values of 4.6 µM, 16.9 µM, and 16.1 µM, respectively – and have demonstrated a substrate-competitive inhibition profile toward TrxR1 and pro-apoptotic efficacy toward cancer cells10. Other disulphide compounds – 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (8 also known as DTNB or Ellman’s reagent)11, thioredoxin reductase fluorogenic substrate (9 or TRFS-green)12 and mitochondria-targeted “mito-TRFS” (10)13 have not been employed as TrxR inhibitors but rather as fluorescent probes, also due to their being substrate (disulphide-linked Trx) analogues. Based on the structure of these disulphide TrxR ligands, we designed a series of symmetric (11) and non-symmetric (12–13) derivatives of dithiodiglycolic acid (Figure 1). Herein, we report the results of their synthetic exploration and biological testing for TrxR inhibition and cytotoxicity toward two human cancer cell lines and normal human keratinocytes.",

Particularly relevant to the present study are the disulphide substrate analogues: e.g. alkyl 2-imidazolyl disulphides 1–38 (2, whose Ki value toward the enzyme was determined as 31 µM, is also known as PX-12 and has been in Phase 1 clinical trials for advanced metastatic cancer and was stopped due to safety concerns6), disodium 2,2′-dithio-bis-ethane sulphonate 49 (also known as TravoceptTM which advanced through phase III clinical trials in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and has a Km value of 72 µM6) as well as bicyclic disulphide-containing natural products chaetocin (5), gliotoxin (6) and chaetomin (7) which have been shown to possess Km values of 4.6 µM, 16.9 µM, and 16.1 µM, respectively – and have demonstrated a substrate-competitive inhibition profile toward TrxR1 and pro-apoptotic efficacy toward cancer cells10. Other disulphide compounds – 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (8 also known as DTNB or Ellman’s reagent)11, thioredoxin reductase fluorogenic substrate (9 or TRFS-green)12 and mitochondria-targeted “mito-TRFS” (10)13 have not been employed as TrxR inhibitors but rather as fluorescent probes, also due to their being substrate (disulphide-linked Trx) analogues. Based on the structure of these disulphide TrxR ligands, we designed a series of symmetric (11) and non-symmetric (12–13) derivatives of dithiodiglycolic acid (Figure 1). Herein, we report the results of their synthetic exploration and biological testing for TrxR inhibition and cytotoxicity toward two human cancer cell lines and normal human keratinocytes.",
