                "pl_string": "Aminoguanidine derivatives have recently been the focus of numerous studies because of their diverse range of biological properties, including their antibacterial6, antifungal7 anti-inflammatory8, and antimicrobial activities9. In addition, in previous studies, researchers have reported that the development of a series of chalcone with aminoguanidine derivatives showed some activity in the inhibition of tumour cells (such as HeLa and Hep3B)10, however, their activity was not high enough (8.7 µg/mL and 15.3 µg/mL respectively). Pyrazoles occupy a distinct niche in heterocyclic chemistry and represent a key motif in medicinal chemistry because of their capability to exhibit an array of bioactivities, including antimicrobial11,12, anticancer13,14, anti-inflammatory15, antidepressant16, anticonvulsant17, and selective enzyme inhibitory18 activities. Furthermore, the benzothiazole nucleus is a unique scaffold that is promising for further molecular exploration, and for the synthesis of novel compounds. Literature surveys revealed that benzothiazole analogues are associated with diverse pharmacological effects19–21 (Figure 1(c)). Especially, the anticancer activity of benzothiazole with pyrazole has received increased attention22 (Figure 1(d)). Therefore, to improve the antitumor activities of this type of compounds, in this study a series of new compounds were designed and synthesised by reserving the aminoguanidine moiety, and replacing the chalcone moiety by 1-benzo[d]thiazole-3-phenyl-pyrazole (named 2-(3-phenyl-pyrazol-1-yl)benzo[d]thiazole).

                "pl_string": "Aminoguanidine derivatives have recently been the focus of numerous studies because of their diverse range of biological properties, including their antibacterial6, antifungal7 anti-inflammatory8, and antimicrobial activities9. In addition, in previous studies, researchers have reported that the development of a series of chalcone with aminoguanidine derivatives showed some activity in the inhibition of tumour cells (such as HeLa and Hep3B)10, however, their activity was not high enough (8.7 µg/mL and 15.3 µg/mL respectively). Pyrazoles occupy a distinct niche in heterocyclic chemistry and represent a key motif in medicinal chemistry because of their capability to exhibit an array of bioactivities, including antimicrobial11,12, anticancer13,14, anti-inflammatory15, antidepressant16, anticonvulsant17, and selective enzyme inhibitory18 activities. Furthermore, the benzothiazole nucleus is a unique scaffold that is promising for further molecular exploration, and for the synthesis of novel compounds. Literature surveys revealed that benzothiazole analogues are associated with diverse pharmacological effects19–21 (Figure 1(c)). Especially, the anticancer activity of benzothiazole with pyrazole has received increased attention22 (Figure 1(d)). Therefore, to improve the antitumor activities of this type of compounds, in this study a series of new compounds were designed and synthesised by reserving the aminoguanidine moiety, and replacing the chalcone moiety by 1-benzo[d]thiazole-3-phenyl-pyrazole (named 2-(3-phenyl-pyrazol-1-yl)benzo[d]thiazole). In these compounds, we simultaneously changed the substituents on the benzo[d]thiazole and investigated the effects of these compounds on anti-proliferative activity. The structure of target compounds is shown in Figure 1.",
