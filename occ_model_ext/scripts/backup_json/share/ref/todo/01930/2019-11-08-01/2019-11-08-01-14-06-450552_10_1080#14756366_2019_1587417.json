Herein, we applied the heterocycle replacement and shape-based scaffold hopping strategy towards PFI-1, a BRD inhibitor developed by Pfizer Worldwide R&D. First, we analysed the binding mode of PFI-1 binds to the BRD4 bromodomain. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that PFI-1 binds to BRD4 with three key hydrogen bonds interactions, which are displayed in Figure 3(A). The carbonyl oxygen and NH group of the dihydroquinazolinone forms two critical hydrogen bonds with the conserved residue Asn140. Moreover, the carbonyl oxygen interacts with the conserved residue Tyr97 via a water-mediated hydrogen bond. The anisole group occupies the WPF (formed by residues W97, P98 and F99) shelf and forms hydrophobic interaction with Asp145, Ile146, and Met149. The sulphonamide forms two additional hydrogen bonds with two water molecules. With this structural information in mind, we hypothesised that rational replacement of the dihydroquinazolinone core via coumarin skeleton based on scaffold hopping would be tolerated (Figure 3(B)). Thus, a series of novel coumarin derivatives were designed. As shown in Figure 3(C), the docking mode of coumarin derivative 1 binds to BRD4 was consistent with that of PFI-1. The alignment results depicted in Figure 3(D) also indicated that 1 almost took the same interaction conformation as PFI-1 except that the hydrogen-bond interaction between NH and Asn140 was lost.",

It has been extensively used for the design of structurally novel bioactive molecules35–38, which generally incorporates ring opening, ring closure, heterocycle replacement, and shape/topology-based scaffold hopping39,40. Herein, we applied the heterocycle replacement and shape-based scaffold hopping strategy towards PFI-1, a BRD inhibitor developed by Pfizer Worldwide R&D. First, we analysed the binding mode of PFI-1 binds to the BRD4 bromodomain. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that PFI-1 binds to BRD4 with three key hydrogen bonds interactions, which are displayed in Figure 3(A). The carbonyl oxygen and NH group of the dihydroquinazolinone forms two critical hydrogen bonds with the conserved residue Asn140. Moreover, the carbonyl oxygen interacts with the conserved residue Tyr97 via a water-mediated hydrogen bond. The anisole group occupies the WPF (formed by residues W97, P98 and F99) shelf and forms hydrophobic interaction with Asp145, Ile146, and Met149. The sulphonamide forms two additional hydrogen bonds with two water molecules. With this structural information in mind, we hypothesised that rational replacement of the dihydroquinazolinone core via coumarin skeleton based on scaffold hopping would be tolerated (Figure 3(B)). Thus, a series of novel coumarin derivatives were designed. As shown in Figure 3(C), the docking mode of coumarin derivative 1 binds to BRD4 was consistent with that of PFI-1. The alignment results depicted in Figure 3(D) also indicated that 1 almost took the same interaction conformation as PFI-1 except that the hydrogen-bond interaction between NH and Asn140 was lost.",
