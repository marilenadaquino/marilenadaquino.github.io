However, very often the developed inhibitors were poorly selective, being able to inhibit indiscriminately all or most of the hCA isozymes1,2,16. With the aim to obtain more selective CAIs, recent years saw the continuous development and testing of molecules containing new chemotypes such as the carboxylates, polyamines, sulfocoumarins, and coumarins17–21. Among them the benzoxaborole derivatives were recently shown to have good inhibitory properties against α- and β-CAs from pathogenic fungi and protozoans22,23, as well to be effective on different hCA isoforms (Table 1)24. In particular, the lead compound benzoxaborole 1 was shown to act as a selective hCA I and hCA II inhibitor and to bind the enzyme active site in its tetrahedral anionic form independently from the pH used in crystallisation experiments (Figure 1). Interestingly, two different binding modes were observed: in the first one, one of the hydroxyl groups of the benzoxaborole was anchored to the catalytic zinc ion, completing its tetrahedral coordination (Figure 1(B)), whereas, in the second one, the inhibitor was bound to the zinc ion with two of its oxygen atoms, generating a trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry of zinc (Figure 1(C))24. The substitution pattern at the benzoxaborole ring was deeply investigated too, showing that benzoxaboroles containing urea and thiourea moieties (compounds 2 and 3 in Table 1) were able to discriminate between the different CA isoforms24. Based on these interesting data, in this article, we further extend the characterisation of ureido/thioureido-benzoxaboroles by means of X-ray crystallography and binding free energy calculations.",
