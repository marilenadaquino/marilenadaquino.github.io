In many CA isoforms, it has been shown that residue His64 placed in the middle of the active site cavity is involved in this phenomenon, acting as a natural proton shuttle residue during the catalytic cycle11. Confirmation that CAAs have a similar role to His64, that is, shuttling of the protons from the active site to the environment and facilitation of the formation of the nucleophilic enzyme species, came from many X-ray crystallographic studies of isoforms CA I and II complexed with amine and amino acid activators3–6. Histamine, the first CAA investigated by means of X-ray crystallography3, was observed to bind at the entrance of the active site cavity, distant from the zinc ion, and participating in a network of hydrogen bonds involving several water molecules, which, as for His64, favour the release of the proton from the water molecule coordinated to the zinc, to the reaction medium3. X-ray crystal of other CAAs reinforced the above findings: all activators bind in the same active site region, at the entrance of the cavity, from where they can enhance the formation of the zinc hydroxide species of the enzyme, by favouring the proton shuttling between the cavity and the reaction medium3–6. Furthermore, recently, it has also been shown the CAAs may have pharmacological applications for enhancing cognition, in the management of CA deficiencies, for therapy memory and for obtaining artificial tissues12. Thus, there is a strong interest in designing CAAs belonging to various chemical classes, in order to detect compounds with high efficacy and eventually isoform-selective action, considering that in humans at least 15 CA isoforms were described so far7.
