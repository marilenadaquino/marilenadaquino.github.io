When the bacilli are inhaled, they reach the alveolar spaces of the lungs and are mainly ingested by macrophages. As a consequence, TB primarily affects the lungs, but at later stages it can also spread to other vital organs. Despite significant improvements with respect to diagnosis, treatment, and preventive measures have been successfully implemented in many healthcare systems around the world, this disease still remains the world’s biggest threat to human health causing 54 million deaths between 2000 and 20171. Standard therapeutic regimens have remained substantially unchanged over the past 60 years with outdated drugs and very long therapies that are still used for the treatment of new and relapse cases. In addition to the length of the cure, other hurdles related to the management of TB infections include interactions with drugs used in comorbid conditions, especially HIV, and severe side effects. All these issues contribute to determine a poor patient compliance that, together with the improper use of TB antibiotics, has led to the insurgence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacterial strains2–4. As confirmed by the latest WHO report, drug resistance is becoming a real emergency; therefore, there is a growing interest in the development of novel anti-TB compounds5–8. A few of them reached clinical trials and two drugs, delamanid and bedaquiline, have been recently approved; however, more information on their effectiveness, safety, and tolerability are still required because severe side effects have been reported9,10. In this scenario, the research of many more TB drug candidates to sustain an effective and productive drug pipeline is pivotal. Targeting Mtb iron uptake systems is now a validated strategy for the development of antimycobacterial compounds, because iron is essential for Mtb survival in the host and its acquisition is strongly correlated with virulence11. Among the four different iron acquisition pathways used by Mtb, the most thoroughly characterised one is based on the production of two types of siderophores: carboxymycobactins, which acquire iron extracellularly and transport it into the cytoplasm of the bacteria, and mycobactins, which facilitate the transport of iron through the cell wall into the cytoplasm. Notably, targeting this biosynthetic process is an attractive strategy, because its impairment lowers the pathogen virulence and survival without causing toxicity issues. Indeed, as this pathway is absent in humans, the risk of off-target effects is minimal; moreover, being an unexplored biological process for the development of drugs, there is no known resistance mechanism. The first step of the biosynthesis of these siderophores is catalysed by the Mg2+-dependent enzyme salicylate synthase (MbtI), a validated pharmacological target12–15, whose crystal structure has been recently solved16.",

For CAS assay, an aliquot of 100 µL of supernatant was mixed with 100 µL of CAS assay liquid solution in a 96-well plate, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and the absorbance was measured at 630 nm. For mycobactin determination, cell pellets were extracted in ethanol overnight, then 0.1 M FeCl3 in ethanol was added until no color change was observed. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, then mycobactins were extracted in chloroform, washed with water, evaporated and the residue was dissolved in methanol.
