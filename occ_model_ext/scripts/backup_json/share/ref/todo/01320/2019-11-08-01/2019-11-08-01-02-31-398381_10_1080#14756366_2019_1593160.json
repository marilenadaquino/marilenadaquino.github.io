Protein kinase inhibitors has received great attention in the last decades due to their ongoing role in fighting cancer2. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptor that mediates several signal transduction cascades [Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, Jak/STAT] which regulate cell proliferation, growth and apoptosis3. EGFR over-expression is implicated in various types of cancer such as breast, colon, ovarian and prostate through enhancing the cancer cell proliferation, invasiveness, metastasis and angiogenesis4–7. Moreover, EGFR-signaling pathways stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)8 which is considered as the key inducer of tumor angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is the process of blood vessel formation that starts with dilatation and increase in the vascular permeability of the existing capillaries and venules. Followed by activation, migration and proliferation of the endothelial cells, of the blood vessels to form the new capillaries9. Binding of VEGF with VEGFR-2 stimulates signaling pathways (p38MAPK, PI3K/Akt) that mediate several cellular functions such as proliferation, migration, survival and vascular permeability for the tumor cell and hence promotes angiogenesis10. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that VEGFR-2 are highly expressed in cancer cells especially endothelial cells11. In addition, both glycoproteins, EGFR and VEGFR-2 are closely related; inhibition of EGFR decreasing the expression of VEGF, whereas targeting of VEGFR-2 potentiate the anticancer activity of EGFR inhibitors12–14. Therefore, recent therapies based on dual inhibition of both EGFR and VEGFR-2 represents a promising cancer treatment protocol15,16. Recently, several EGFR/VEGFR-2 dual inhibitors have been discovered14,17–19, such as vandetanib (ZD6474, Caprelsa®, Figure 1) that exhibited potent inhibitory activity against both EGFR and VEGFR-2 (with IC50=0.50, 0.04 µM, respectively)20. Vandetanib had FDA approval in 2011 for treatment of thyroid cancer21. In addition, such 4-anilinoquinazoline derivative substituted with halogen atoms in position 2 and 4 of the anilino group showed significant anticancer activity against breast, colorectal and lung cancers22–26.",

Angiogenesis is the process of blood vessel formation that starts with dilatation and increase in the vascular permeability of the existing capillaries and venules. Followed by activation, migration and proliferation of the endothelial cells, of the blood vessels to form the new capillaries9. Binding of VEGF with VEGFR-2 stimulates signaling pathways (p38MAPK, PI3K/Akt) that mediate several cellular functions such as proliferation, migration, survival and vascular permeability for the tumor cell and hence promotes angiogenesis10. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that VEGFR-2 are highly expressed in cancer cells especially endothelial cells11. In addition, both glycoproteins, EGFR and VEGFR-2 are closely related; inhibition of EGFR decreasing the expression of VEGF, whereas targeting of VEGFR-2 potentiate the anticancer activity of EGFR inhibitors12–14. Therefore, recent therapies based on dual inhibition of both EGFR and VEGFR-2 represents a promising cancer treatment protocol15,16. Recently, several EGFR/VEGFR-2 dual inhibitors have been discovered14,17–19, such as vandetanib (ZD6474, Caprelsa®, Figure 1) that exhibited potent inhibitory activity against both EGFR and VEGFR-2 (with IC50=0.50, 0.04 µM, respectively)20. Vandetanib had FDA approval in 2011 for treatment of thyroid cancer21. In addition, such 4-anilinoquinazoline derivative substituted with halogen atoms in position 2 and 4 of the anilino group showed significant anticancer activity against breast, colorectal and lung cancers22–26.",

Protein kinase inhibitors has received great attention in the last decades due to their ongoing role in fighting cancer2. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptor that mediates several signal transduction cascades [Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, Jak/STAT] which regulate cell proliferation, growth and apoptosis3. EGFR over-expression is implicated in various types of cancer such as breast, colon, ovarian and prostate through enhancing the cancer cell proliferation, invasiveness, metastasis and angiogenesis4–7. Moreover, EGFR-signaling pathways stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)8 which is considered as the key inducer of tumor angiogenesis.
