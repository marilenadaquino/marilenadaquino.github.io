The importance of this somewhat unusual relationship is supported by the ubiquitous co-expression of matriptase with HAI-1 in epithelial and carcinoma cells4,19 and the fact that concomitant deletion of matriptase rescues the placental and epidermal defects, and chronic inflammation caused by the genetic deletion of HAI-1 in mice20–23. In light of this, it was a surprise that many matriptase-expressing neoplastic B-cells were found to lack significant expression of HAI-11,2. This suggested that neoplastic B-cells must be equipped with some other protease inhibitor to substitute for HAI-1, not only for the control of matriptase activity, but also to replace the HAI-1 chaperone function facilitating matriptase synthesis and intracellular trafficking. HAI-2, another membrane-associated Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, highly related to HAI-124, has also been shown to be able to inhibit matriptase activity and to support matriptase synthesis and intracellular trafficking25–28.
