It is the most widely prescribed α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitor. However, it was previously shown that only a mild inhibition of pancreatic α-amylase is recommended in order to avoid gastrointestinal side-effects as a result of excessive bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates in colon11, that has been shown as a limiting factor for T2DM treatment, in some countries11. In the present work, the IC50 values found for the tested flavonoids were higher than the IC50 value found for acarbose, which is 1.3 ± 0.2 µM. The mild pancreatic α-amylase inhibition prevents the abnormal bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates in the colon and consequent gastrointestinal adverse effects, such as abdominal distention, flatulence and diarrhea11. Moreover, it was previously shown by our research group that, in general, the tested flavonoids were more effective concerning the inhibition of α-glucosidase than the inhibition of α-amylase15. As such, the obtained results suggest that flavonoids could be promising α-amylase inhibitors and cause less gastrointestinal side-effects. Interestingly, it was found that the combination of baicalein or apigenin with acarbose showed additive inhibition of α-amylase at lower concentrations and antagonistic inhibition at higher concentrations. On the other hand, the combination of baicalein with acarbose synergistically inhibits α-glucosidase and lowers HGPP54.",
