The hTopoIIα inhibitors can be divided into two categories, hTopoIIα poisons and hTopoIIα catalytic inhibitors3. For hTopoIIα poisons (etoposide, doxorubicin, anthracyclines and mitoxantrone), they are clinically active agents that generate a high level of hTopoII–DNA covalent complexes by stimulating cleavage of the G-segment and blocking relegation of DNA7. On the other hand, hTopoIIα catalytic agents (ICRF-187, novobiocin, merbarone and salvicine) affect the catalytic cycle of hTopoIIα by elimination of the enzymatic activity8–10. Although these different catalytic agents share the same effect, they interact with hTopoIIα at different binding sites. For example, the ICRF-187 binding pocket is located in the middle of the primary dimer interface8, while merbarone acts by blocking the DNA cleavage reaction of hTopoIIα.

The starting structures of the 47 designed chalcone derivatives were built by the GaussView program43, while those of salvicine and etoposide were taken from the ZINC database44. To validate the docking method, the co-crystallised ligands were initially docked into the binding pocket with 100 independent runs, i.e. docking of AMP-PNP into the ATP-binding site of the hTopoIIα ATPase domain (1ZXM.pdb), and etoposide into its binding pocket of the hTopoIIα/DNA complex (3QX3.pdb). The position of docked ligands did not differ significantly from the crystallised conformation ligands (RMSD = 0.80 Å for AMP-PNP and 0.44 Å for etoposide) and so the 47 chalcones were then separately docked into both sites, while salvicine (used as the reference compound at the ATPase domain) was only docked into the ATP-binding site. The chalcones with predicted interaction energies towards hTopoIIα that were more favorable than those of the known inhibitors were synthesised and their in vitro cytotoxicity against the three cancer cell lines was tested (see Section 2.3.3).",
