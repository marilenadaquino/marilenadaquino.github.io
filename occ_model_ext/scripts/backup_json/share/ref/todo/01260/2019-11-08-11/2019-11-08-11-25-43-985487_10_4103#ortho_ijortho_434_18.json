Knees were cut at approximately 200 mm proximal to the femur and distal tibia. All soft tissues were carefully dissected. Anteromedial and posterolateral (AM and PL) bundles were identified according to the difference in tension patterns during complete knee range of motion. With the knee at 90Â° of flexion, relaxed fibers of the ACL were regarded as the PL bundle.2,121314 After soft tissue resection, the ACL was cut in half. On the femoral side, the femur was split along the sagittal plane through the most superior point of the anterior outlet of the intercondylar notch with an oscillating saw to expose the femoral attachment of the ACL. The outline of the whole femoral ACL footprint was marked first with colored ink, and the midsubstance insertion site of the femoral ACL footprint was then marked [Figure 1a].2 Following the identification of the AM and PL bundle midsubstance fibers, the midsubstance insertion and the fan-like extensions were divided according to the AM and PL bundles and marked.2,121314 Referring to the midsubstance tissue of the ACL, the border between the midsubstance insertion area and fan-like extension fibers of the ACL footprint was clearly distinguished.14 As the intercondylar ridge could not be found out in every knee in this study, the ridge was not referred for the evaluation of the ACL footprint. An accurate lateral view of the femoral condyle was photographed with a digital camera (Casio, Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).214 When the pictures were taken, a measure was placed at the same plane of the footprint.
