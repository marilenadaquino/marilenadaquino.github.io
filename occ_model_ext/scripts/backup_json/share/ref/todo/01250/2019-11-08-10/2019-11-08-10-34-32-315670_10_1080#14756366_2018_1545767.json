A competitive inhibitor can bind to a free enzyme and prevents substrate binding to the enzyme active site. Regarding the property that tyrosinase is a metalloenzyme, copper chelators such as many aromatic acids, phenolic and poly-phenolic compounds, a few non-aromatic compounds, can inhibit tyrosinase competitively by mimicking the substrate of tyrosinase52,60. Recently, it was found that d-tyrosine negatively regulates melanin synthesis by inhibiting tyrosinase activity, competitively113. In addition, l-tyrosine has been shown as an inhibitor114.",

Their results approved the inhibitory activity of these extracts against tyrosinase: Achyrocline satureioides, Artemisia verlotiorum, Cotoneaster glaucophylla, Dalea elegans, Flourensia campestris, Jodina rhombifolia, Kageneckia lanceolata, Lepechinia floribunda, Lepe-chinia meyenii, Lithrea molleoides, Porlieria microphylla, Pterocaulon alopecuroides, Ruprechtia apetala, Senna aphylla, Sida rhombifolia, Solanum argentinum, Tagetes minuta, and Thalictrum decipiens. Besides, plants from the Moraceae family including genera Morus species, Artocarpus, Maclura (Cudrania), Broussonetia, Milicia (Chlorophora), and Ficus have shown in vitro tyrosinase inhibition148. Also, ethanolic and methanolic extracts of some other plants such as Ardisia elliptica Thunb149, Phyllanthus acidus (L.) Skeels, Rhinacanthus nasutus L. Kurz (IC50 value of 271.50 µg/ml), Arbutus andrachne L. (IC50 = 1 mg/mL)150, Withania somnifera L. Dunal and Solanum nigrum L. berries151, Pulmonaria officinalis and Centarium umbellatum152 and Camel’s foot creeper leaves (Bauhinia vahlii)153 significantly inhibited tyrosinase activity, too. Quispe et al. have screened tyrosinase inhibitory properties of Peruvian medicinal plants. Among these plant extracts, Hypericum laricifolium Juss, Taraxacum officinale F.H.Wigg. (IC50 value of 290.4 µg/ml), and Muehlenbeckia vulcanica Meisn (IC50 value of 280.1 µg/ml) showed the greatest anti-tyrosinase activity154. Furthermore, tyrosinase inhibitory activity of mangrove plants in Micronesia155, Korean indigenous plants156, plants from Brazilian Cerrado157, five traditional medicinal plants from Iran158, ethanol extracts from medicinal and edible plants cultivated in Okinawa159, seashore plants160, some tropical plants161 and Bangladeshi indigenous medicinal plants162, have been investigated by various researchers.

Minor flavonoids included: dihydroflavones, flavan-3,4-diols, coumarins, chalcones, dihydrochalcones and aurones241. Also, prenylated and vinylated flavonoids, such as flavonoid Glycosides, are other subclasses of flavonoids. Some flavonoid glycosides such as myricetin 3-galactoside and quercetin 3-O-β-galactopyronaside from Limonium tetragonum133 and 3',5'-di-C-β glucopyranosylphloretin from unripe calamondin peel (IC50 = 0.87 mg/ml)229, have been investigated for their inhibitory activities on tyrosinase. Moreover, the inhibitory activities of some other prenylated and vinylated flavonoids, such as kuwanon C, papyriflavonol A, sanggenon D and sophoflavescenol, and sanggenon D (IC50 = 7.3 µM) against tyrosinase, have been approved by Lee et al.242. However, according to their findings, the prenylation with isoprenyl group or the vinylation of some flavonoid molecules does not enhance their tyrosinase inhibitory activity242. Interestingly, it has even demonstrated that deglycosylation of some flavonoid glycosides by far-infrared irradiation can be improved tyrosinase inhibitory activity243.

Minor flavonoids included: dihydroflavones, flavan-3,4-diols, coumarins, chalcones, dihydrochalcones and aurones241. Also, prenylated and vinylated flavonoids, such as flavonoid Glycosides, are other subclasses of flavonoids. Some flavonoid glycosides such as myricetin 3-galactoside and quercetin 3-O-β-galactopyronaside from Limonium tetragonum133 and 3',5'-di-C-β glucopyranosylphloretin from unripe calamondin peel (IC50 = 0.87 mg/ml)229, have been investigated for their inhibitory activities on tyrosinase. Moreover, the inhibitory activities of some other prenylated and vinylated flavonoids, such as kuwanon C, papyriflavonol A, sanggenon D and sophoflavescenol, and sanggenon D (IC50 = 7.3 µM) against tyrosinase, have been approved by Lee et al.242.

                "pl_string": "Resveratrol is the most common stilbene. Several stillbenes derivatives from natural and synthetic sources (Figure 8) have been investigated for their tyrosinase inhibition activity including: resveratrol from Morus alba319, Pleurotus ferulae135, vitis viniferae caulis320, Carignan grape juice321Artocarpus gomezianus322 and Streptomyces avermitilis MA4680323 and also, its derivatives from Dipterocarpaceae plants324 and synthetic sources325, oxyresveratrol326 from Morus australis327, Morus alba L (IC50 = 0.10 ± 0.01 µM)249 and Cudrania cochinchinensis (IC50 = 2.33 µM)255, azo-resveratrol and its derivatives such as (E)-2-((2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)diazenyl) phenyl 4 methylbenzenesulfonate328 and azo-oxyresveratrol329, trans-resveratrol from Streptomyces avermitilis MA4680 313, a resveratrol dimer named gnetin C, from melinjo (Gnetum gnemon)330. Also, several hydroxystillbene compounds from synthetic and semisynthetic sources331,332 and from the extract of Veratrum patulum333, along with synthetic glycosides of resveratrol, pterostilbene, and pinostilbene334, synthetic trans-stilbene derivatives335, azastilbene analogs336, a newly synthesised stillbene 5-(6-hydroxy-2-naphthyl)-1,2,3-benzenetriol337, coumarin-resveratrol hybrids290, synthetic polyphenolic deoxybenzoins218, hydroxy substituted 2-phenyl-naphthalenes338 and 4-(6-hydroxy-2-naphthyl)-1,3-bezendiol339 have been studied for their inhibition activity against tyrosinase. However, based on the enzymatic assays, resveratrol did not inhibit the diphenolase activity of tyrosinase, but L-tyrosine oxidation by tyrosinase was suppressed in presence of 100 µM resveratrol. Interestingly, after the 30 min of preincubation of tyrosinase and resveratrol, both monophenolase and diphenolase activities of tyrosinase were significantly suppressed. Furthermore, this effect was reduced with the addition of l-cysteine, which indicated suicide inhibition mechanism of resveratrol340. Also, oxyresveratrol201 is identified as a tyrosinase substrate like hydroquinone, arbutin, caffeic acid and some other inhibitors. In addition to these studies on resveratrol, Fachinetti et al., have demonstrated that the incorporation of resveratrol into nanostructured lipid carriers allowed an enhanced tyrosinase inhibitory activity341.",
