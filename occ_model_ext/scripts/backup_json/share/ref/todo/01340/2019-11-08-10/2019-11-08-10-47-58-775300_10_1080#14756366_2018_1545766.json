The reaction was carried out in a 48-well plate at 37 °C on a final volume of 500 μL of a phosphate buffer solution (TPS 0.1 M pH 8), each well containing 200 μL of 0.875 mM of DTNB (5,5′-dithiobis -2-nitrobenzoic acid in PBS 1×) and 5 μL hAChE (CSU 3.6 U/mL) or 5 μL hBuChE (CSU 5 U/mL) for a final concentration of 0.036 U/mL or 0.05 U/mL in each well. The reaction was started by adding acetylthiocholine (AcTCh) at 0.35 mM (Cf in the well) for hAChE, and butyrylthiocholine (BuTCh) at 1 mM (Cf in the well). The enzymatic reaction was monitored at 410 nm of absorbance during 5 min for hAChE and 8 min for hBuChE in a Biotek Power Wave XS spectrophotometer plate reader (kinetic measure each 15 s). Inhibition curves were performed by pre-incubation of this mixture with at least five concentrations of each compound (10 nM–100 μM in case of hAChE, and 10 pM-75 μM in case of hBuChE) for 10 min. A control sample (without compound) and a tacrine dilution at IC50 concentration (500 nM for hAChE and 30 nM for hBuChE) were always included to determine 100% of the enzymatic activity in each assay.
