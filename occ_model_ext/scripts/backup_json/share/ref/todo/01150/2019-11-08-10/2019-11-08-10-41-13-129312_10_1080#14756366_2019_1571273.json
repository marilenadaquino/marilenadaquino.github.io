CA inhibitors (CAIs) targeting such pathogenic enzymes8–14,17–19 were reported in the last decade5,8,11,13–15 and are considered as an alternative to clinically used antibacterials, for which a wide range of resistance was reported in the last decades5. Furthermore, pathogenic fungi such as Candida glabrata5,22, C. albicans5, Cryptococcus neoformans5,22 or Malassezia globosa23 also encode for β-CAs which were demonstrated to be druggable, with many interesting inhibitors belonging to various classes reported, some of which also showed some efficacy in vivo5,22,23. Pathogenic protozoans, such as Plasmodium falciparum or Trypanosoma cruzi also encode for CAs belonging to various classes (η-CA for the first pathogen7, and α-CA for the second one24) which were shown to be inhibited efficiently by sulphonamide CAIs, with antiprotozoans effects in vitro and ex vivo24.
