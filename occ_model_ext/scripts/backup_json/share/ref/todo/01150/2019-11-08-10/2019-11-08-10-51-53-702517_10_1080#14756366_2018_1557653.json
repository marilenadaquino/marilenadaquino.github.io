Although, partial selectivity of several toxins (such as okadaic acid and tautomycin) in the inhibition of PP1 and PP2A are proven in vitro, there are still concerns with respect to their specificity in cellular systems6 due to their differences in membrane permeability and intracellular concentrations. Nevertheless, calyculin A and tautomycin have been shown to specifically inhibit PP2A and PP1 in Balb/c 3T3 cells7, respectively, and this distinction between PP1 and PP2A by these toxins was also confirmed in THP1 leukemic8 and endothelial9 cells by phosphatase activity assays. Even though, the use of toxins to differentiate between the cellular actions of phosphatase types is limited due to cytotoxicity of these compounds. Thus, search for phosphatase inhibitory molecules has not ceased and still tremendous attempts are made to identify novel ones or increase the selectivity of known inhibitors.
