Maestro GUI37 was employed to build the 3D theoretical structures of our derivatives. Both tautomers/conformers were taken into account. Quantum mechanics optimisation was performed by means of Jaguar38 software using the DFT B3LYP method and 6–311 G** as basis set. The resulting structure population was estimated according to Boltzmann analysis at 300 K. Protein Data Bank (PDB)39 crystallographic structures, deposited with the corresponding codes 2Z5X40 and 6FW041, were used as receptor models of hMAO-A and hMAO-B, respectively. Both PDB structures were prepared as follows before the docking simulation: missing atoms and FAD bond order were fixed, hydrogen atoms were added and co-crystallised water molecules and ligands, harmine and chlorophenyl-chromone-carboxamide for 2Z5X and 6FW0, respectively, were removed. After preparation, the Glide42 software was used to generate ligand configurations in the enzymatic clefts, which were defined by a regular box of about 64,000 Å3 centred on the FAD N5 atom. Ligand structural flexibility was taken into account by the software by a maximum of 10 docking configurations for ligand were generated. The binding affinity was estimated by means of the standard precision (SP) scoring function and the top-ranked complexes, according to Glide Score, were considered for the binding modes analyses. In order to evaluate the non-bonded interaction energy contribution, the Glide Energy and its components Glide Ecoul and EvdW were examined.",
