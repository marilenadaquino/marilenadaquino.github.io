Theycomprise a broad variety of lipase structures with common structural traits1. Yeasts’ secretion of lipases supporttheir establishment in plants by hydrolysing epicuticular waxes, which enables access tonutrition and carbohydrates in the roots of plants as a survival mechanism2. Candida rugosa is anespecially potent species that secretes 5 isoforms of lipases with an identity of 77%.Despite their structural similarity, the five isoforms of Candida rugosalipase (CRL) covers a broad specificity range in catalysing the breakdown of lipids intofatty acids and glycerol3; which isalso the reason why this subset is widely used in the industry, for instance, in theproduction of biodiesel and pharmaceuticals4,5.This broad specificity range enables Candida rugosa to hydrolyse fattyacids preferentially from position 1 or 3 on the glyceride with an additional preference formedium- and long-chain fatty acid, but no preference between saturated and unsaturated fattyacids as well as cholesterol6–8. The varying specificity within the isoforms is caused bysequential differences in a conserved loop and tunnel domain, which determines the activityand specificity of the respective isoforms7,9,10.The loop is composed of an α-helix in the closedconformation, where it lays planar on the molecule’s surface covering the catalytic centre(catalytic triad: Ser209-His449-Glu341, a water molecule, and the oxyanion hole) as well asthe tunnel entrance inhibiting catalytic activity11,12. For the transition in the open conformation, the respective loophas to travel 19 Å, positioning itself perpendicular to the enzyme’s surface exposing thecatalytic centre and the tunnel entrance and refolding itself into two αα-helices11,12. One of the acyl groups on the glyceride cansubsequently move into the accessible tunnel domain, which contains several functionalgroups stabilising the hydrophobic acyl chain. This positions the ester bond connecting thefatty acid and glycerol in the catalytic centre, initiating the hydrolysis activity andsubsequently releasing a free fatty acid as well as diacylglyceride11. Changes in the sequence by site-directed mutation ofboth the loop and the tunnel domain can have effects on specificity and activity of theenzyme7,13. In addition, it was discovered thatCRL isoforms’ activity is very sensitive to pH and temperature changes4,14. While the application of immobilisation strategies as well as theaddition of hydrophobic organic solvents or emulsions showed to enhance the enzyme’sactivity by stabilising the exposed hydrophobic areas in the open conformation15–18, certainexperimental conditions can even change the direction of the catalytic reaction, meaning anester bond formation instead of hydrolysis19. Although allosteric modulation is very effective and is abiochemical method to alter enzymatic activity and specificity, it has not been consideredin the past due to the mentioned alternative procedures, complexity and cost-intensity ofhigh-throughput screening with numerous potential modulators. In modern approaches, theidentification of allosteric sites is simplified through pre-screening of potentialallosteric modulators by computational analysis, which pre-sorts and reduces the pool ofscreening component as well as complexity and cost-intensity20–22. However, in-silicobased screening requires an X-ray-crystallography structure of the respective enzyme as wellas high-performance software and hardware, an in-vitro screening assay,which can verify the theoretically determined ligands and their influence on the enzyme’sactivity.",

Yeasts’ secretion of lipases supporttheir establishment in plants by hydrolysing epicuticular waxes, which enables access tonutrition and carbohydrates in the roots of plants as a survival mechanism2. Candida rugosa is anespecially potent species that secretes 5 isoforms of lipases with an identity of 77%.Despite their structural similarity, the five isoforms of Candida rugosalipase (CRL) covers a broad specificity range in catalysing the breakdown of lipids intofatty acids and glycerol3; which isalso the reason why this subset is widely used in the industry, for instance, in theproduction of biodiesel and pharmaceuticals4,5.This broad specificity range enables Candida rugosa to hydrolyse fattyacids preferentially from position 1 or 3 on the glyceride with an additional preference formedium- and long-chain fatty acid, but no preference between saturated and unsaturated fattyacids as well as cholesterol6–8. The varying specificity within the isoforms is caused bysequential differences in a conserved loop and tunnel domain, which determines the activityand specificity of the respective isoforms7,9,10.The loop is composed of an α-helix in the closedconformation, where it lays planar on the molecule’s surface covering the catalytic centre(catalytic triad: Ser209-His449-Glu341, a water molecule, and the oxyanion hole) as well asthe tunnel entrance inhibiting catalytic activity11,12. For the transition in the open conformation, the respective loophas to travel 19 Å, positioning itself perpendicular to the enzyme’s surface exposing thecatalytic centre and the tunnel entrance and refolding itself into two αα-helices11,12. One of the acyl groups on the glyceride cansubsequently move into the accessible tunnel domain, which contains several functionalgroups stabilising the hydrophobic acyl chain. This positions the ester bond connecting thefatty acid and glycerol in the catalytic centre, initiating the hydrolysis activity andsubsequently releasing a free fatty acid as well as diacylglyceride11. Changes in the sequence by site-directed mutation ofboth the loop and the tunnel domain can have effects on specificity and activity of theenzyme7,13. In addition, it was discovered thatCRL isoforms’ activity is very sensitive to pH and temperature changes4,14. While the application of immobilisation strategies as well as theaddition of hydrophobic organic solvents or emulsions showed to enhance the enzyme’sactivity by stabilising the exposed hydrophobic areas in the open conformation15–18, certainexperimental conditions can even change the direction of the catalytic reaction, meaning anester bond formation instead of hydrolysis19. Although allosteric modulation is very effective and is abiochemical method to alter enzymatic activity and specificity, it has not been consideredin the past due to the mentioned alternative procedures, complexity and cost-intensity ofhigh-throughput screening with numerous potential modulators. In modern approaches, theidentification of allosteric sites is simplified through pre-screening of potentialallosteric modulators by computational analysis, which pre-sorts and reduces the pool ofscreening component as well as complexity and cost-intensity20–22. However, in-silicobased screening requires an X-ray-crystallography structure of the respective enzyme as wellas high-performance software and hardware, an in-vitro screening assay,which can verify the theoretically determined ligands and their influence on the enzyme’sactivity.",

                "pl_string": "Lipases or triacylglycerol acyl hydrolases (EC 3.1.1.3) catalyse the hydrolysis of triacylglycerides to release fatty acids and glycerol, an established mechanism in yeast. Theycomprise a broad variety of lipase structures with common structural traits1. Yeasts’ secretion of lipases supporttheir establishment in plants by hydrolysing epicuticular waxes, which enables access tonutrition and carbohydrates in the roots of plants as a survival mechanism2. Candida rugosa is anespecially potent species that secretes 5 isoforms of lipases with an identity of 77%.Despite their structural similarity, the five isoforms of Candida rugosalipase (CRL) covers a broad specificity range in catalysing the breakdown of lipids intofatty acids and glycerol3; which isalso the reason why this subset is widely used in the industry, for instance, in theproduction of biodiesel and pharmaceuticals4,5.This broad specificity range enables Candida rugosa to hydrolyse fattyacids preferentially from position 1 or 3 on the glyceride with an additional preference formedium- and long-chain fatty acid, but no preference between saturated and unsaturated fattyacids as well as cholesterol6–8. The varying specificity within the isoforms is caused bysequential differences in a conserved loop and tunnel domain, which determines the activityand specificity of the respective isoforms7,9,10.The loop is composed of an α-helix in the closedconformation, where it lays planar on the molecule’s surface covering the catalytic centre(catalytic triad: Ser209-His449-Glu341, a water molecule, and the oxyanion hole) as well asthe tunnel entrance inhibiting catalytic activity11,12.
