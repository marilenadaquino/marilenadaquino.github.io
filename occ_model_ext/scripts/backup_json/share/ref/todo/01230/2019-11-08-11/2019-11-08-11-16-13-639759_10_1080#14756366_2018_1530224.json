PARP-1 utilizes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as substrate to catalyse the transfer of ADP-ribose units to nuclear target proteins upon oxidative stress and DNA injury. Over-activation of PARP-1 will lead to cellular depletion of NAD+ and ATP, and then, energy deficiency slows glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration rates, resulting in controlled nerve cell death. This PARP-related specific neurodegenerative mechanism was termed as parthanatos10. Meanwhile, over-activated PARP-1 will increase its interaction with transcription regulators such as nuclear receptors, sirtuins, and other metabolic transcription factors. Further, it will also lead to the impairment of mitochondrial function that seems to be an early and critically important event in the pathogenesis of AD9,11. Although the role of PARP-1 in human AD is not fully elucidated and many mechanisms are under investigations, accumulating evidences suggest that PARP-1 inhibitors are viable to neuroprotection and PARP-1 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for AD12,13. As for AD, it still imposes a great threat to human health. Currently, most of the approved drugs for AD treatment are acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, namely donepezil, tacrine, rivastigmine and galantamine. Nevertheless, these drugs modestly alleviate the symptoms but cannot cure brain damage or stop neuronal degeneration14. Therefore, discovery for effective anti-AD drugs remains an enormous challenge to medicinal chemistry communities. In fact, in addition to AChE, there is another cholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), in the synaptic gap of neuronal cells to efficiently hydrolyse acetylthiocholine (ACh), and its inhibitors have been reported to be more beneficial to AD in later stages of AD than AChE inhibitors15–17. In the light of the multifactorially pathological mechanisms of AD, developing multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) may be a more promising approach for its treatment. Some researches and reviews of MTDLs for AD have already been reported18,19, but almost none of which is related to both PARP-1 and cholinesterase inhibitors20.

However, its anticancer activity was not potent enough7,21, and it showed dose-limiting toxicity that was more pronounced than that seen with the chemotherapeutic agents alone when it was utilized in combination with chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment22. To overcome these shortcomings, several modifications based on structural skeleton of Olaparib have been reported (Figure 1)21–24. The reported structure–activity relationship (SAR) revealed that 4-benzyl phthalazinone was the core scaffold responsible for moderate PARP-1-inhibiting potency, and a substituted piperazine at the meta position of benzyl moiety was conducive to enhancing activity and maintaining good oral bioavailability7,25. In view of the important therapeutic value of PARP-1 inhibitor for cancer and potentially for AD treatment, it was interesting and deserved to further explore structural optimization of Olaparib based on the existed SAR. With this aim in mind, we decided to keep the 4-benzyl phthalazinone group unchanged and replace the cyclopropane group of Olaparib by substituted aryl vinyl ones to constitute 3-aromatic α, β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety. On the one hand, the aryl vinyl groups are hydrophobic, just like cyclopropane group, which is helpful to improve oral bioavailability7; on the other hand, 3-aromatic α, β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety is widely included into natural products, especially within chalcone framework that possesses a variety of bioactivities, including anticancer, inhibition of cholinesterases and neuroprotection26–28. Through the structural optimizations, we hoped to find a more potent PARP-1 inhibitor, at the same time, in order to explore new MTDLs for the treatment of AD, the inhibitory activities against AChE and BChE enzymes of these compounds were also evaluated. Here, we described the synthesis and bioactivities assays of 15 Olaparib derivatives; meanwhile, molecular dockings were conducted to investigate their interaction fashion with the corresponding proteins.",

However, its anticancer activity was not potent enough7,21, and it showed dose-limiting toxicity that was more pronounced than that seen with the chemotherapeutic agents alone when it was utilized in combination with chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment22. To overcome these shortcomings, several modifications based on structural skeleton of Olaparib have been reported (Figure 1)21–24. The reported structure–activity relationship (SAR) revealed that 4-benzyl phthalazinone was the core scaffold responsible for moderate PARP-1-inhibiting potency, and a substituted piperazine at the meta position of benzyl moiety was conducive to enhancing activity and maintaining good oral bioavailability7,25. In view of the important therapeutic value of PARP-1 inhibitor for cancer and potentially for AD treatment, it was interesting and deserved to further explore structural optimization of Olaparib based on the existed SAR. With this aim in mind, we decided to keep the 4-benzyl phthalazinone group unchanged and replace the cyclopropane group of Olaparib by substituted aryl vinyl ones to constitute 3-aromatic α, β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety. On the one hand, the aryl vinyl groups are hydrophobic, just like cyclopropane group, which is helpful to improve oral bioavailability7; on the other hand, 3-aromatic α, β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety is widely included into natural products, especially within chalcone framework that possesses a variety of bioactivities, including anticancer, inhibition of cholinesterases and neuroprotection26–28. Through the structural optimizations, we hoped to find a more potent PARP-1 inhibitor, at the same time, in order to explore new MTDLs for the treatment of AD, the inhibitory activities against AChE and BChE enzymes of these compounds were also evaluated. Here, we described the synthesis and bioactivities assays of 15 Olaparib derivatives; meanwhile, molecular dockings were conducted to investigate their interaction fashion with the corresponding proteins.",
