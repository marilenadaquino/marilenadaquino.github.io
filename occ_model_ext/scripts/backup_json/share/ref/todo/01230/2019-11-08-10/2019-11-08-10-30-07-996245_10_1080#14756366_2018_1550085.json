The 3 D structures of the compounds were constructed in Avogadro v1.2.042 and were subjected to 10,000 steepest descent steps of energy minimisation in the MMFF94 force field. One hundred poses were generated for each ligand, and the best-ranked models were chosen for further visual inspection in order to assess the consistency of the generated docking solutions relative to the docking poses of known inhibitor colchicine. Molecular graphics and visual analyses were performed in The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.8.2. (Schrödinger, LLC). Logp values were calculated using the ChemAxon/Chemicalize server (www.chemicalize.com).",
