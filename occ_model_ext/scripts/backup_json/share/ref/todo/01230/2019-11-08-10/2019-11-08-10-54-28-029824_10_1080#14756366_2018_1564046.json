The interaction of EGFRs with the ligands causes receptor homo- and hetero-dimerisation, this interaction initiates a cascade of events that control diverse biological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. Thus, deregulation of this transduction pathway has been implicated in many types of human cancers and is associated with poor clinical prognosis2–5. Moreover, members of EGFR family have been shown to be oncogenic. High expression levels of EGFR and ErbB2 has been implicated in the development of various types of cancers including breast, lung, colorectal, ovarian, prostate, head and neck6–8. EGFR and ErbB2 pathways are interconnected since both receptors have the highest homology among the EGFR family members in their kinase catalytic domains and share many similar biochemical and kinetic properties9. Additionally, the use of multiple ErbB receptors for cell proliferation and survival in tumour cells and the synergistic transforming effects of EGFR and ErbB2 lead to the hypothesis that targeting both the EGFR and ErbB2 catalytic domains simultaneously through dual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibition would have superior therapeutic effects relative to single-agent treatment for cancer10. Furthermore, a multi-targeted approach may improve the outcome of anti-EGFR therapies since the blockade of EGFR by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors is insufficient to eradicate established tumors because of independently activated survival pathways11. Erlotinib (TarcevaTM)12, Gefitinib (IressaTM)13 and Lapatinib (TykerbTM)14 (Figure 1) are low-molecular-weight dual inhibitors of EGFR/ErbB2 tyrosine kinases that compete with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to block the catalytic domain of these receptors. They had been approved for the chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer patients. The main structural features of these drugs are quinazoline scaffold containing a substituted phenyl amino pyrimidine moiety. Purine is a heterocyclic nucleus which exists in the chemical architecture of various bioactive compounds. It is an important pharmacophore, which is widely used in the development of protein kinase inhibitors via introduction of substituents on the 2, 6 and 9 positions15. Pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine as a bioisostere of purine has drawn a considerable attention as a privileged scaffold for the design and discovery of novel anticancer agents16,17. In addition, pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine or its bioisostere pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine are common structural motifs of potent dual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitors such as PKI16618,I (AEE788)19, II20 and III21 (Figure 1). Motivated by all these findings, we have designed and synthesised a series of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines as novel small molecules targeting both EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases to be useful for treatment of cancer via inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis. Our strategy was directed towards carrying out the chemical modifications on the general features of anilinoquinazoline scaffold to substantiate the effect of such modifications on the anticancer activity and to identify potent anticancer agents (Figure 2). Initially, we aimed to replace the benzene moiety in the quinazoline skeleton by an isostere (pyrazole one). This respected nucleus is always bearing a 4-fluorophenyl group at N1 since fluorinated compounds are one of the research hotspots in modern medicinal chemistry22. Moreover, incorporation of a fluorine atom provides compounds with enhanced both pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties as compared to their non-fluorinated analogs23,24.

We have introduced unsubstituted phenyl amino group, phenyl amino group substituted with electron donating groups or phenyl amino group substituted with electron withdrawing groups.

In the fourth modification, we have focused on replacement of the phenyl amino group by small pharmacophoric moieties as carbonyl, amino, morpholine, 4-methylpiperazine or hydrazinyl groups. These groups at such position are well acknowledged for the anticancer activity of the fused pyrimidine rings25,26. Finally, additional amino group was introduced at C-6 position of pyrazolopyrimidine core. Twelve of the newly synthesised pyrazolopyrimidines were subjected to in vitro anticancer screening by the National Cancer Institute (USA) against 60 different human cell lines. The most potent compound was selected to be further studied through determination of its half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values against ovarian cancer OVCAR-4, lung cancer NCI-H460, NCI-H226 and renal cancer ACHN cell lines. In order to explore the mechanistic pathways of the anticancer activity of 7d, it was evaluated in EGFR, ErbB2 and active caspase-3 assays.

                "pl_string": "The EGFR family comprises four distinct membrane tyrosine kinase receptors: (EGFR/ErbB1, HER2/ErbB2, HER3/ErbB3 and HER4/ErbB4) located in the plasma membrane and activated in response to ligand binding1,2. The interaction of EGFRs with the ligands causes receptor homo- and hetero-dimerisation, this interaction initiates a cascade of events that control diverse biological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. Thus, deregulation of this transduction pathway has been implicated in many types of human cancers and is associated with poor clinical prognosis2–5. Moreover, members of EGFR family have been shown to be oncogenic. High expression levels of EGFR and ErbB2 has been implicated in the development of various types of cancers including breast, lung, colorectal, ovarian, prostate, head and neck6–8. EGFR and ErbB2 pathways are interconnected since both receptors have the highest homology among the EGFR family members in their kinase catalytic domains and share many similar biochemical and kinetic properties9. Additionally, the use of multiple ErbB receptors for cell proliferation and survival in tumour cells and the synergistic transforming effects of EGFR and ErbB2 lead to the hypothesis that targeting both the EGFR and ErbB2 catalytic domains simultaneously through dual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibition would have superior therapeutic effects relative to single-agent treatment for cancer10. Furthermore, a multi-targeted approach may improve the outcome of anti-EGFR therapies since the blockade of EGFR by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors is insufficient to eradicate established tumors because of independently activated survival pathways11. Erlotinib (TarcevaTM)12, Gefitinib (IressaTM)13 and Lapatinib (TykerbTM)14 (Figure 1) are low-molecular-weight dual inhibitors of EGFR/ErbB2 tyrosine kinases that compete with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to block the catalytic domain of these receptors. They had been approved for the chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer patients. The main structural features of these drugs are quinazoline scaffold containing a substituted phenyl amino pyrimidine moiety. Purine is a heterocyclic nucleus which exists in the chemical architecture of various bioactive compounds. It is an important pharmacophore, which is widely used in the development of protein kinase inhibitors via introduction of substituents on the 2, 6 and 9 positions15. Pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine as a bioisostere of purine has drawn a considerable attention as a privileged scaffold for the design and discovery of novel anticancer agents16,17. In addition, pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine or its bioisostere pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine are common structural motifs of potent dual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitors such as PKI16618,I (AEE788)19, II20 and III21 (Figure 1). Motivated by all these findings, we have designed and synthesised a series of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines as novel small molecules targeting both EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases to be useful for treatment of cancer via inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis. Our strategy was directed towards carrying out the chemical modifications on the general features of anilinoquinazoline scaffold to substantiate the effect of such modifications on the anticancer activity and to identify potent anticancer agents (Figure 2). Initially, we aimed to replace the benzene moiety in the quinazoline skeleton by an isostere (pyrazole one). This respected nucleus is always bearing a 4-fluorophenyl group at N1 since fluorinated compounds are one of the research hotspots in modern medicinal chemistry22. Moreover, incorporation of a fluorine atom provides compounds with enhanced both pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties as compared to their non-fluorinated analogs23,24. The second modification focused on introducing various phenyl amino groups on the pyrimidine moiety. We have introduced unsubstituted phenyl amino group, phenyl amino group substituted with electron donating groups or phenyl amino group substituted with electron withdrawing groups. The third modification included incorporating the phenyl amino group to the pyrimidine nucleus through a spacer such as azomethine group or piperazinyl linker. In the fourth modification, we have focused on replacement of the phenyl amino group by small pharmacophoric moieties as carbonyl, amino, morpholine, 4-methylpiperazine or hydrazinyl groups. These groups at such position are well acknowledged for the anticancer activity of the fused pyrimidine rings25,26. Finally, additional amino group was introduced at C-6 position of pyrazolopyrimidine core. Twelve of the newly synthesised pyrazolopyrimidines were subjected to in vitro anticancer screening by the National Cancer Institute (USA) against 60 different human cell lines. The most potent compound was selected to be further studied through determination of its half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values against ovarian cancer OVCAR-4, lung cancer NCI-H460, NCI-H226 and renal cancer ACHN cell lines. In order to explore the mechanistic pathways of the anticancer activity of 7d, it was evaluated in EGFR, ErbB2 and active caspase-3 assays. Moreover, we also investigated its effect on the normal cell cycle profile and induction of apoptosis in the OVCAR-4 cell line.",
