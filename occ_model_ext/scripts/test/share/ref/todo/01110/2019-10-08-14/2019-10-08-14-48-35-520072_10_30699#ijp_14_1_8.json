The BRAF oncogene transmits growth signals to protein kinases on the RAS oncogenic pathway. The most important and frequent mutation of BRAF is V600E, which results in the substitution of the valine amino acid by glutamic acid at position 600, thereby dysregulating the activation map of the kinase/ERK signaling pathway, leading finally to melanoma genesis (14,15).

Noteworthy BCCs and SCCs can show pigmentation, and some other pigmented skin neoplasms may have borderline manifestations that simulate malignant melanomas, the most aggressive kind of skin cancer (7,8). A variety of tumor markers that are useful in differentiating benign and malignant neo- plasms and different types of cancers have been studied. The BRAF oncogene has been considered as one of themost important markers that play a role in the pathogenesis of tumors including thyroid, ovarian, and colorectal carcinoma, as well as malignant melanoma (9-13). The BRAF oncogene transmits growth signals to protein kinases on the RAS oncogenic pathway. The most important and frequent mutation of BRAF is V600E, which results in the substitution of the valine amino acid by glutamic acid at position 600, thereby dysregulating the activation map of the kinase/ERK signaling pathway, leading finally to melanoma genesis (14,15). Therefore, it can be a good subject for studies to differentiate benign and malignant skin neoplasms, thus predicting tumor behavior and planning specific target therapy by new drugs such as vemurafenib against BRAF V600E (12).",
