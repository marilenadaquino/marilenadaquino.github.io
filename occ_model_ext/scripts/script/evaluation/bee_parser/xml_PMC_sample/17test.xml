Following oral antibiotic treatment in our mouse model, AD phenotypes, including clinical score, TEWL, and IgE levels, were found to be aggravated and the expression level of the skin inflammatory cytokine IL4 was increased, whereas these parameters were improved by transplantation of feces from healthy mice or oral probiotic treatment. Our mechanistic results suggested that modulation of SCFA production by microbiota in the gut can regulate the CD4<sup>+</sup>IL17<sup>+</sup> T cell/CD4<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell balance, thereby affecting the levels of ILC3 in the gut mucosa. Based on our current findings, the mechanisms underlying the development and treatment of AD should consider interactions between intestinal microbiota and other AD-related parameters.</p><p>In our AD mouse model, intestinal SCFA production was altered by fecal transplantation or oral probiotic treatment compared to that of antibiotic-treated animals. The levels of propionate and butyrate SCFAs showed significant increases when oral probiotics or healthy feces were administered to the mice. Notably, both propionate and butyrate have recently been reported to promote the accumulation of Treg cells in the colon by directly activating dendritic cells and T cells or G protein signals.<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>SCFAs are produced by gut microbiota as fermentation products and are required by intestinal epithelial cells to modulate immune responses to invading pathogens and commensal bacteria.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Therefore, SCFAs prevent chronic intestinal inflammatory responses to microbes and their products. In our study, we found that the dysbiosis induced by antibiotic treatment elicits intestinal inflammation affecting the production of SCFAs in the intestine. The delicate balance between pro- (Th17) and anti-inflammatory (Treg) mechanisms essential for gut immune homeostasis is affected by the composition of the commensal microbial community and how they influence, for example, the SCFA profile.<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>In the present study, however, we did not investigate the effects on the skin of oral antibiotic, fecal matter from healthy mice, or probiotic administration, and the effects of these treatments on AD require further investigation.</p><p>Intestinal bacteria play important roles in metabolism, immune cell development, epithelial cell integrity, motility, and prevention of gut colonization by pathogenic strains.<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> We found that antibiotic treatments created an imbalance in the commensal intestinal microbiota, which could be a modern environmental factor with direct influence on intestinal homeostasis. Dysbiosis promotes the release by gram-negative bacteria of endotoxins and flagellin which bind to toll-like receptor 5 and induce intestinal damage and inflammation.<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The proinflammatory cytokine IL17 has been reported to activate signaling pathways and induce the production of proinflammatory molecules that play major roles in neutrophil recruitment and tissue inflammation,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> particularly in autoimmune disease and intestinal cancer.<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In our current analysis, the percentage of intestinal IL17<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibited a significant increase in the antibiotic-treated mice, further indicating that antibiotics induce intestinal dysbiosis and IL17-related inflammation.</p><p>CD4<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells are known to maintain intestinal homeostasis<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and were significantly down-regulated by antibiotic treatment in the AD mice. The intestinal IL17<sup>+</sup> T cell/FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell imbalance was induced by alterations in the gut microbiota and was rescued by oral transplantation of healthy feces or administration of oral probiotics. Therefore, our present data indicate for the first time that an IL17<sup>+</sup> T cell/CD4<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell imbalance in the gut could be a crucial determinant for AD development in early ages.</p><p>ILCs are the most recently described family of lymphoid cells and are known to regulate the development of lymphoid cells and intestinal inflammation,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
<italic>i.e.</italic>, a larger number of ILC3s are associated with intestinal inflammation. These cells are also closely related to the regulation of mucosal adaptive immunity through Treg maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, supporting that ILC3s are also key in this process.<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>Both human and mouse ILC3s express IL22 and IL17, which play roles in tissue infection and inflammation responses during development.<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>Our findings indicate that, like ILC3s, intestinal IL17<sup>+</sup> T cell levels are significantly altered by antibiotic exposure; consequently, intestinal dysbiosis results in increased numbers of both cell types in mice. Butyrate has recently been reported to suppress the number of ILC3s in the intestine.<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Our current SCFA data revealed that probiotic treatment increases the percentage of butyrate and that, compared to antibiotics alone, co-administration of probiotics and antibiotics also reduced the ILC3 population levels in our mouse model. These observations demonstrate that oral probiotic administration promotes intestinal homeostasis by increasing the production of the SCFA butyrate, which modulates ILC3/Treg cell-related mechanisms.</p><p>Our current data on the significance of ILC3s are consistent with those from previous reports; however, due to the small number of available cells, further studies are needed to validate and confirm this relationship.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. It did not investigate the effects of antibiotics on skin changing microbiota and infections. However, the use of antibiotics (cocktail) was more massive in the study rather than in the treatment of pyoderma&#x02019; therefore, the effects could focus on eradication or strong strike of intestinal microbiota. The results in our AD model showed that the skin condition was controlled by systemic immune responses induced by changes in the intestinal microbiota rather than those in skin microbiome.</p><p>Skin commensal microbiota can also produce SCFAs and has similar immune regulatory mechanisms of the intestine by skin Tregs.<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The effect was not considered in the present study and focused on systemic immune modulation by dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota.</p><p>Additionally, the present study had not investigated direct changes in intestinal microbiome by effects of antibiotics and others. Instead, we investigated the SCFAs which are metabolites of microbiome. Based on the previous studies,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> we showed the effects of antibiotics on dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota by SCFAs in mice. Further studies are needed to investigate changes in the intestine and skin microbiome resulting from antibiotic treatment in the AD model.</p><p>In conclusion, antibiotic use in early life needs to be considered in relation to the development or aggravation of AD mediated by gut microbial dysbiosis and associated changes in the SCFA profile. Guidelines are warranted to limit the use of antibiotics in patients at high risk of AD, the underlying mechanisms of which may be linked to IL17-positive and ILC3s.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This research was supported by the Bio &#x00026; Medical Technology Development Program of the National Research Foundation (NRF)
