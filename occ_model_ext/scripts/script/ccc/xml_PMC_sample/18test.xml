We aimed to perform a meta-analysis and meta-regression to determine the effect of low MAP on POCD, as well as moderator variables between low MAP and POCD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p> The Web of Science, PubMed database, Scopus and the Cochrane Library database (up to June 2018) were searched and retrieved articles systematically reviewed. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing maintenance of low MAP (&#x0003c;80 mmHg) and high MAP (&#x0003e;80 mmHg) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were included in our final review. Statistical analysis of the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to report the overall effect. The overall effect and meta-regression analysis were done using Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (MHRR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> A total of 731 patients in three RCTs were included in this study. POCD occurred in 6.4% of all cases.

Microemboli are assumed to be a key factor in development of brain injury after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, but to date the root cause of POCD and relevant risk factors have been poorly differentiated<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. </p><p>Low mean arterial pressure (low MAP) has been one of the most common protocols for decreasing POCD after CPB surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Low MAP reduces bleeding at the surgical site, the need to cardiotomy suction as well as a reduction in the embolic load<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Although several reviews have explored the effectiveness of low MAP in reducing POCD among CABG patients, there is certain doubt concerning estimates of MAP threshold to maintain neuroprotection against embolic load<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Pepin et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> concluded that cerebral autoregulation is maintained by MAP as low as 30 mmHg in moderately hypothermic patients. Murphy et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> and Riley<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> suggested that only high-risk patients may require MAP &#x0003e;70 mmHg including patients with advanced atherosclerotic disease of the aorta, hypertension, diabetes and the elderly. Therefore, guidelines are unable to recommend any specific measures for optimal MAP during CPB. In this regard, clinical practice guidelines for MAP management endorsed by American Society of ExtraCorporeal Technology (AmSECT) advised that the intended treatment algorithm for blood pressure management prior to CPB, including acceptable ranges for blood pressure shall be defined by the perfusion care team<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. Although avoidance of high MAP is emphasized in the literature, no threshold MAP during CPB is recommended due to insufficient published evidence<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, it is necessary to explore both CPB-related and patient-related factors more precisely to determine moderator variables which play an important role in the association between low MAP and POCD. </p></sec><sec><title>OBJECTIVE</title><p>Due to the potential neuroprotective effect of low MAP, its routine use in anesthesiology, especially CPB surgery and the lack of strong findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we aimed to perform a meta-analysis to examine the effect of low MAP on the POCD and a meta-regression to determine whether moderator variables mediate the relationship between low MAP and POCD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Eligibility Criteria</title><p>Only RCTs were incorporated into the current meta-analysis: 1) the population comprised CABG patients; 2) there was an intervention group of lower MAP (&#x0003c;80 mmHg) during CPB surgery; 3) there was a control group of higher MAP &#x02265;80 mmHg) during CPB surgery; 4) the main outcome included POCD.

The incidence of POCD was 6.37% and 6.44% for low MAP and high MAP groups, respectively. The female patients' frequency was lower than that of male patients in all RCTs. The mean CPB time ranges from 74 to 101 minutes. Also the mean time difference between low MAP and high MAP groups is up to 10 minutes. The proportion of patients with diabetes varied widely (16.5% to 33%), as did the range of patients with hypertension (40.32% to 67.39%).

In the study by Charlson et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>, the MAP target has been set by the pre-bypass MAP in the low MAP group, so patients did not receive MAP higher than baseline MAP during CPB. In high MAP group, MAP kept fixed at 80 mmHg and therefore, no one in high MAP group received MAP &#x0003c;80 mmHg. In contrast, several patients received MAP as low as 57 mmHg in low MAP group. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign patients without hypotension to the high MAP group. </p></sec><sec><title>Sensitivity Analysis</title><p>&#x02018;&#x02018;Remove-One&#x02019;&#x02019; sensitivity analysis showed that there was no significant association between low MAP and POCD (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.43) after the exclusion of Charlson et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> study, meaning that overall effect was not biased by the excluded study.

This finding may have critical implications for the therapeutic management of patients undergoing CABG surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>The Role of Low MAP</title><p>It is routine to keep MAP at a level below the physiological threshold around 50 mmHg<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. In most patients, maintaining a sufficient pump flow in the 50 mmHg range does not require any further interventions during CPB<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. The blood supply to the brain is relatively constant because cerebral autoregulation works during CPB when managed either by alpha-stat or pH-stat<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. It is believed that high MAP increases cerebral embolic load as well as the risk of brain injury<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. High MAP results in high CBF, which may increase cerebral embolic load and cerebral edema as well<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. The increasing number of patients with high-risk criteria have raised concerns about the possible indication of high MAP during CPB<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. Patients with atherosclerosis of the aorta, hypertension, diabetes, previous stroke and age &#x0003e;70 years are at high risk for POCD<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Ono et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> showed that keeping blood pressure below the level of autoregulation is significantly associated with increased morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery (OR: 1.36; 95% confidence interval: 1.08-1.71; <italic>P</italic>=0.008). The AUC (area under the curve) for low MAP was greater for patients with high morbidity or mortality than for those without (6.5 <italic>vs</italic>. 2.4 mmHg &#x000d7; min/h). They also showed that average MAP during CPB for patients with high morbidity or mortality is not significantly different (75 <italic>vs</italic>. 74 mmHg) from those for patients without high morbidity or mortality. It is worth mentioning, however, that average MAP did not differ between groups, patients with higher morbidity and mortality had significantly longer CPB duration times (133 <italic>vs</italic>. 106 min)<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>, implying that CPB time as well as low MAP is strongly associated with morbidity and mortality as well.</p><p>In line with other reviews<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, meta-analysis showed that low MAP does not reduce POCD after CABG surgery. However, there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups, the incidence of POCD for very early and late was 6.52 and 4.98, respectively, showing that the trend is consistent with that of reported by Brown et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. They found that there is a logarithmic reduction in the frequency of microemboli as well as the embolic load through days spent after CPB (especially in the first few days after CPB surgery). In our study, there is a trend toward lower occurrence of POCD in the low MAP group (6.37% <italic>vs</italic>. 6.44%), suggesting that a confounding variable may interfere with a significant reduction in the occurrence of POCD in the low MAP group. In search of confounding factors that can influence the occurrence of POCD, we further performed meta-regression of moderator variables. Meta-regression analysis showed that there was a significant association between moderators (CBP time difference and age) and POCD.</p></sec><sec><title>The Role of CPB Surgery Time</title><p>Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that shorter CPB time is related to a lower rate of POCD in either group, suggesting that CPB time is an independent predictor of POCD. In the regression model, patients with longer surgery time had a significantly increased risk for the occurrence of POCD regardless of the type of group. Bearing in mind that no study had a shorter surgery time for the low MAP group, it may explain why the studies' findings have been inconclusive across all previous reviews. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> shows that the protective effect of low MAP can only resist up to 4 minutes of longer mean duration of high MAP. Other studies also support this finding, implying that prolonged CPB time is related to an increasing embolic load<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. The pivotal role of surgery time in CABG patients has fully been understood in the literature<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>. Brown et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> reported that each 60-minute increase in CPB time associates with 30.5% increase in the embolic burden. This increase is more severe in patients with valve repair surgery (145.3% per hour). In this line, a multivariate analysis showed even 30-minute increments in CPB time acts as an independent risk factor for postoperative death significantly (OR=1.57)<sup>[<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. Bucerius et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> indicated that CPB time longer than 2 hours should also be considered as an independent risk factor for stroke (OR=1.42). Therefore, it is implied that the final outcomes after CABG surgery are significantly associated with CPB time. Mean CPB time varied between 74 and 101 minutes and the absolute mean CPB time difference between high MAP and low MAP groups is up to 10 minutes in the present study. However, there was no significant difference in mean CPB time between groups in all RCTs; low MAP groups had experienced greater mean CPB time in all studies<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. So probably the great impact of prolonged CPB time on emboli formation interfered with the neuroprotective effect of low MAP. In addition, we should bear in mind that mean statistics can be highly affected by extreme values and are not appropriate statistics for highly skewed distributions. An analysis of 5,000 patients undergoing CABG showed that the distribution of CPB duration is positively skewed (0.18) and data is dispersed (coefficient of variation=40%), showing that 25% of surgeries lasted longer than 135 minutes (up to 643 minutes)<sup>[<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. In this study, each 30-minute increment in CPB time increased 1.53 times the risk of death, so it implies that final outcomes, such as death, stroke, POCD, are very sensitive to CPB time. In the RCTs included in our review, coefficient of variation (CV) of CPB time is mainly between 20 to 30%, implying that there is considerable dispersion in data. It is also clear that mean statistics is not a valid estimate of skewed data, while dispersed cases have a strong association with the final outcomes. Therefore, dispersity may be responsible for the fact that the neuroprotective effect of low MAP is not significant in the meta-analysis. It is suggested that insignificant difference between mean CPB time is not enough to compare the occurrence of POCD between groups, so patients also need to be stratified for the CPB time.</p></sec><sec><title>The Role of Age</title><p>Increasing age is associated with a higher occurrence of POCD in the low MAP group, based on the meta-regression analysis. Patients may benefit more from high MAP protocol as they age. On the other hand, low MAP protocol did not offer any advantage over the high MAP group. The result must be interpreted carefully, because the mean age varied between 64.75 and 66.87 years among studies (mean difference: 2.12 years). This finding is supported by other studies showing that elderly may need high MAP during CPB<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. However, a multivariable linear regression revealed that MAP was unrelated to POCD, and interactions between age and MAP area less than 50 mm Hg were significant, meaning that hypotension contributed significantly to POCD in the elderly<sup>[<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>. </p></sec><sec><title>The Role of Follow-up Period</title><p>Cognitive status has been assessed in different time periods in the studies (2 days and 6 months). The follow-up period ranges from 2 days after cardiac surgery to 6 months in the current RCTs. Most studies have reported that the highest rates of POCD occurred during the first weeks following CABG surgery. It was also followed by a signi&#x0fb01;cant decline in the incidence rate in the &#x0fb01;rst 6 months<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>. Cormack et al. demonstrated a pattern developed for reduction in POCD across all four measures in the first year after CPB surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. They also reported that there is a decline in half of the routinely used tests in the first week after CPB surgery, specifically in measures that assess psychomotor function<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, the practice effect indicates that the results of patients with POCD may be confounded by the results of patients who showed practice effects over multiple testing sessions<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. However, the improvement in the declining trend in POCD after CABG surgery may be originated from the learning effect. Brown et al. reported that as time passes after CPB, a consistent reduction in the number of microemboli is seen<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, which means that there may be another explanation for the declining trend in POCD. </p></sec><sec><title>The Possible Role of Confounders</title><p>Some part of discrepancy among studies may come from the variability in the definition of POCD<sup>[<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup>. However, Gold et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> and Charlson et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> used a cognitive decline determined <italic>a priori</italic> by a panel of experts in the postoperative score in comparison to the preoperative score that might be different from the commonly used criteria in other neurocognitive studies (1 SD decline). One SD decline in the postoperative score in comparison to the preoperative score is the most commonly used measure to define POCD in the literature. A fixed amount of decline for each patient is used exclusively in this criterion. Mahanna et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> found that this criterion estimates between the higher (20% drop) and lower impairment index rating estimates of cognitive decline. Therefore, one SD decline criterion may miss up to 30% of the occurrence of POCD in both groups<sup>[<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup>. Finally, the both low and high MAP groups have randomly been assigned, so this discrepancy may not be recognized as a source of bias between groups. Cognitive testing is still considered as the cornerstone for POCD measurement in the light of limitation of POCD definition. In addition, Gold et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> and Charlson et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> defined POCD if occurred in three or more tests; that is clearly distinct from that of most of the research conducted in neurocognitive assessment (in one or more tests)<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, the result must be interpreted cautiously because the neurocognitive criteria are strict.</p><p>Patients lost to follow-up ranged from 3.1% to 12.38% in the present study. Meta-regression analysis revealed a significant association between the occurrence of POCD among RCTs and loss to follow-up (MH log RR: 0.358, 95% CI: 0.030-0.687, <italic>Z-</italic>value 2.138, <italic>P</italic>-value=0.032). Loss to follow-up in Siepe et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> was 12.38% in very early assessment. The validity of studies in which more than 20% of patients are lost to follow-up is questionable<sup>[<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup>. After exclusion of the study of Siepe et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>, there was also no significant association between low MAP and POCD. It is worth mentioning that MHRR decreased from 1.012 to 0.681 in favor of low MAP insignificantly. In current studies, the rate of loss to follow-up is not significantly different between groups in order to lessen the bias caused by a notable dropout rate.</p><p>There may be multiple factors contributing to POCD, but very few of them have been proven to have the remarkable effect on cognitive deficit as much as CPB time. CABG surgery with valve repair may put patients as a greater risk for the occurrence of POCD than isolated CABG surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. All RCTs excluded valve repair, so it is not a concern in the current meta-analysis. Comparison of on- and off-pump among patients in CABG groups has not shown significant differences in the occurrence of POCD. In this way, a meta-analysis revealed that there is no significant protective effect for off-pump CABG<sup>[<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. On-pump CABG surgery is used in all RCTs, so surgery technique may not confound the results. </p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the Present Study</title><p>Several limitations may be considered for this meta-analysis. The studies have been conducted from 1995 to 2011, so did not succeed to contact authors to access the raw data. The skewness of CPB time would be calculated if we had access to median CPB time. The effect of low MAP on cognitive deficit after CPB surgery with focus on CPB time deserves further investigation and it is necessary to conduct homogeneous follow-up timing and consensual definition of cognitive deficit. </p><p>However, Turner et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> argued that when at least two adequately powered studies are available in meta-analysis, underpowered studies often contribute little information, so the result is reliable. Large multicenter, randomized studies are needed to provide additional data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Meta-analysis showed that POCD must be considered as a common event among CABG patients. Older patients may benefit less from low MAP. The neuroprotective effect of low MAP on POCD was attenuated by the prolonged CPB time. Shorter CPB time is related to a lower occurrence of POCD. Low MAP may decrease the risk of POCD after CABG surgery if CPB time stratified rigorously between low MAP and high MAP patients. </p><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FHK</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; final approval of the version to be published</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AS</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; final approval of the version to be published</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MRH</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; final approval of the version to be published</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was carried out at the Department of Anesthesiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>No financial support.</bold></p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>No conflict of interest.</bold></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cormack</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Shipolini</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Awad</surname><given-names>WI</given-names></name><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>McCormack</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Colleoni</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>A meta-analysis of cognitive outcome following coronary artery bypass graft surgery</article-title><source>Neurosci Biobehav Rev</source><year>2012</year><volume>36</volume><issue>9</issue><fpage>2118</fpage><lpage>2129</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.neubiorev.2012.06.002</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22732162</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="r2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gholipour Baradari</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Habibi</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Habibi</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Nouraei</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Administration of lidocaine to prevent cognitive deficit in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and valve plasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis</article-title><source>Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol</source><year>2017</year><volume>10</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>179</fpage><lpage>185</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/17512433.2017.1266252</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">27892772</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="r3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name><name><surname>Moody</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Challa</surname><given-names>VR</given-names></name><name><surname>Stump</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammon</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Longer duration of cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with greater numbers of cerebral microemboli</article-title><source>Stroke</source><year>2000</year><volume>31</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>707</fpage><lpage>713</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1161/01.STR.31.3.707</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10700508</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="r4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Haddock</surname><given-names>CK</given-names></name><name><surname>Poston</surname><given-names>WS</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Neurocognitive sequelae following coronary artery bypass graft.
