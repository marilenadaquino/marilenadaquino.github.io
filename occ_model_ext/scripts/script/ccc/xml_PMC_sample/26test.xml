The CAs catalyse the basic reaction of reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and proton<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>. This reaction is fundamental for biochemical processes in all living organisms<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>.

In contrast, vertebrates and mammals contain only &#x003b1;-CAs<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>. In humans, the CAs regulate a broad range of physiological processes, such as respiration, transport of carbon dioxide/bicarbonate between the lung and metabolising tissues, pH homeostasis, and electrolyte secretion in many tissues and organs<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>. There are 15 CA isoforms in humans of which 12 are catalytically active. Three are inactive due to the lack of one or more of the three-histidine residues required for enzymatic activity<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2&#x02013;3</sup></xref>. The human CA isoforms differ from one another in cellular localisation, distribution in organs, levels of expression in tissues and their kinetic properties<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4&#x02013;5</sup></xref>. The human CA isoforms have high sequence and structural similarities, and therefore only subtle differences exist in their active sites<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6&#x02013;7</sup></xref>.</p><p>In humans, increased expression of CA isoforms is sometimes associated with certain disease conditions<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>.

Many CA inhibitors have been used for treating various human diseases<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>. Even if the inhibitors achieve desirable therapeutic effects, they may cause unacceptable level of toxicity in humans<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>, most probably due to the off-target effects attributable to the inhibition of CA isoforms that are not involved in the target disease or due to general toxic effects of the chemical<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>. Therefore, to target particular therapeutic areas with minimal off-target effects, inhibition of specific enzymes is necessary. Thus, there is a particular need to develop inhibitors that are not only selective against the human CAs but are also safe for clinical use<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>.</p><p>Along this line, we have previously developed numerous potent CA inhibitors that are not only effective against specific human &#x003b1;-CAs and mycobacterial &#x003b2;-CAs, but also show minimal toxicity and are suitable for developing further for clinical use as drugs<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14&#x02013;16</sup></xref>.

The rationale was to investigate a strategy of dual targeting (hypoxia and hCA IXn/hCA XII) in the context of anticancer agents<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref>. Previous results have shown the validity of this approach when conjugation of 5-nitroimidazole derivatives to CA inhibitors structures led to new radiosensitiser agents targeting hypoxic tumours<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17&#x02013;20</sup></xref>. To further investigate the effect and the influence of the 5-nitro imidazole moiety and develop new potent and safer inhibitors, we have been continuing our research on new inhibitors in the nitroimidazole series.

However, a detailed analysis of the videos at the end of 5&#x02009;d of inhibitor exposure showed that the larvae of the inhibitor treated groups (125&#x02009;&#x000b5;M) were not as active and tended to remain at the sides of petri dish compared to the control group larvae (Representative video of swim pattern treated with compound <bold>3</bold>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/14756366.20/14756366.2019.1685510">Supplementary Appendix A</ext-link>). The results of the current study reveal that the larvae treated with <bold>3</bold>, <bold>4</bold> and <bold>10</bold> become slower while swimming as compared to the swim pattern of the control group larvae. However, swim pattern of larvae treated with <bold>3</bold>, <bold>4</bold> and <bold>10</bold> was unlike the larvae treated with nitroimidazole-based inhibitors DTP338 and DTP348, which showed ataxic movement pattern due to neurotoxicity at a concentration as low as 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;M<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>. Therefore, these novel thiourea and sulphonamide derivatives can be considered safer for further preclinical characterisation and development as potential drugs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0022"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we have designed and synthesised thiourea and sulphonamide derivative compounds with the potential to inhibit human CA I, CA II and CA IX. These proteins which play important pathophysiological roles in human diseases, such as well-known role of CA IX in the progression of solid tumours, and those of CA I and CA II in retinal and cerebral oedema, glaucoma, epilepsy and altitude sickness. The inhibition kinetics of these inhibitors were studied against recombinant human hCA I, hCA II and hCA IX <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>. Among these compounds, <bold>4</bold> was the most efficient against hCA II (<italic>K<sub>I</sub></italic> 58.6&#x02009;nM). <bold>10</bold> inhibited human CA IX with <italic>K<sub>I</sub></italic> 147.3&#x02009;nM. The inhibition properties of these inhibitors against the three hCA isoforms prompted us to test these drugs further for their safety in a zebrafish larval model.</p><p>The toxicological evaluation indicated that these inhibitors showed no adverse morphological changes nor did they cause abnormal swim pattern at any sub-millimolar concentration. Taken together, the results from both <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> inhibition studies and toxicological evaluation, we suggest that these inhibitors could be developed into potential drugs targeting hCA I, hCA II and hCA IX with no, or minimal, off-target effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM6169"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="IENZ_A_1685510_SM6169.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d37e246" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Aulikki Lehmus and Marianne Kuuslahti for the histochemical analyses of the zebrafish samples.
